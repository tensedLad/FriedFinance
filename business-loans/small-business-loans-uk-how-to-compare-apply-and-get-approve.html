          <p>Small business loans are the most common form of external funding in the UK. Over 350,000 businesses apply for one every year. Yet the market is more fragmented than it's ever been.</p>
          
          <p>High-street banks still dominate, but alternative lenders now account for nearly 40% of small business lending. Peer-to-peer platforms, fintech lenders, and invoice finance providers compete alongside Barclays and Lloyds. This is good news for borrowers, more choice usually means better deals, but it also means more confusion.</p>
          
          <p>Here's how to cut through the noise.</p>
          
          <h2 id="what-counts-as-a-small-business-loan">What Counts as a Small Business Loan?</h2>
          
          <p>In the UK lending market, small business loans typically refer to borrowing between £1,000 and £500,000 for businesses with annual turnover under £25 million. Beyond that threshold, you're in corporate lending territory with different products and processes.</p>
          
          <p>Most small business loans fall into one of these structures:</p>
          
          <p><strong>Fixed-rate term loans</strong> give you certainty. You borrow a fixed amount, repay over an agreed period (usually 1-10 years), and your monthly payment never changes. Rates currently range from 3.5% to 15% APR depending on your risk profile and the lender.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Variable-rate facilities</strong> link to the Bank of England base rate plus a margin. Cheaper when rates are low, risky when they rise. With the base rate sitting at 4.5% in early 2026, variable loans aren't as attractive as they were five years ago.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Asset finance</strong> lets you borrow against specific assets like vehicles, machinery, or technology. The asset itself serves as security, which typically means lower rates than unsecured borrowing.</p>
          
          <h2 id="where-to-get-a-small-business-loan">Where to Get a Small Business Loan</h2>
          
          <h3 id="high-street-banks">High-Street Banks</h3>
          
          <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Lowest rates (from 3.5% APR), longer repayment terms, existing relationship advantages.</p>
          <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Slower decisions (2-6 weeks), stricter criteria, typically require 2+ years trading history.</p>
          
          <p>Best for: established businesses with strong books and time to wait.</p>
          
          <h3 id="onlinealternative-lenders">Online/Alternative Lenders</h3>
          
          <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Fast decisions (often same-day), more flexible criteria, will consider shorter trading history.</p>
          <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Higher rates (7-25% APR), shorter maximum terms, some charge monthly rather than annual interest.</p>
          
          <p>Best for: businesses needing quick access, those with less-than-perfect credit, or younger companies.</p>
          
          <h3 id="peer-to-peer-platforms">Peer-to-Peer Platforms</h3>
          
          <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Competitive rates for strong profiles, transparent fee structures.</p>
          <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Not guaranteed to fully fund, investor appetite can fluctuate.</p>
          
          <p>Best for: creditworthy businesses in sectors investors understand.</p>
          
          <h3 id="government-backed-schemes">Government-Backed Schemes</h3>
          
          <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Reduced lender risk means higher approval rates, some offer fixed low rates.</p>
          <p><strong>Cons:</strong> More paperwork, specific eligibility requirements.</p>
          
          <p>Best for: businesses that struggle with mainstream lending criteria.</p>
          
          <h2 id="how-to-compare-small-business-loans-properly">How to Compare Small Business Loans Properly</h2>
          
          <p>Comparing loans isn't as simple as looking at the interest rate. Here's what actually matters:</p>
          
          <p><strong>Total cost of borrowing.</strong> Calculate the full amount you'll repay over the loan term, including all fees. A loan at 7% with a 3% arrangement fee costs more than a clean 8% loan.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Repayment flexibility.</strong> Can you overpay without penalty? Is there an early repayment charge? Some lenders charge up to 5% of the outstanding balance if you pay early, making it expensive to clear debt when business is good.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Personal guarantee requirements.</strong> Understand exactly what you're signing. Some guarantees cover 100% of the loan balance. Others are limited to a percentage. This makes a material difference to your personal risk exposure.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Speed of funding.</strong> If you need money in 48 hours, a bank's 3-week process is irrelevant regardless of how good the rate is.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Covenants and conditions.</strong> Some loans come with financial covenants. Minimum revenue thresholds, profitability requirements, or restrictions on additional borrowing. Breaching these can trigger default clauses even if you're current on repayments.</p>
          
          <h2 id="the-application-process-step-by-step">The Application Process Step by Step</h2>
          
          <p><strong>1. Prepare your financials.</strong> At minimum: 12 months of bank statements, most recent filed accounts, and management accounts if your filed accounts are older than 6 months.</p>
          
          <p><strong>2. Check your credit.</strong> Both personal (Experian, Equifax, TransUnion) and business (Creditsafe, Dun & Bradstreet). Fix errors before applying.</p>
          
          <p><strong>3. Define exactly what you need.</strong> Amount, purpose, and timeline. "About fifty thousand for various things" won't cut it.</p>
          
          <p><strong>4. Approach 2-3 lenders.</strong> Use soft-search tools where available to avoid multiple hard credit checks. Many brokers offer this.</p>
          
          <p><strong>5. Compare offers in writing.</strong> Get formal quotes with all fees itemised. Verbal quotes mean nothing.</p>
          
          <p><strong>6. Read the full agreement.</strong> Especially the default clauses, personal guarantee terms, and what constitutes a "material adverse change" clause.</p>
          
          <h2 id="improving-your-approval-odds">Improving Your Approval Odds</h2>
          
          <p><strong>Reduce outstanding debt first.</strong> Your debt-to-income ratio directly affects affordability calculations. Paying off a £10,000 credit balance could unlock a £50,000 business loan.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Show consistent revenue.</strong> Lenders love predictability. If your income swings wildly month to month, explain why in your application. Seasonal businesses should highlight annual patterns.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Offer security if possible.</strong> Secured loans have significantly higher approval rates and lower interest rates. Even partial security helps.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Use a specialist broker.</strong> Brokers know which lenders approve which profiles. A good broker saves you time and protects your credit file by targeting the right lender first time.</p>

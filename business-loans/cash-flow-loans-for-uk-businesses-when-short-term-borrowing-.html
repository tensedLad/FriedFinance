          <p>Cash flow is the single biggest reason UK businesses fail. Not profitability, not lack of customers, but the timing mismatch between when you spend money and when you receive it.</p>
          
          <p>A cash flow loan addresses this specific problem. It provides short-term funding to cover operational expenses during periods when more money is going out than coming in, with the expectation that incoming revenue will repay the debt.</p>
          
          <h2 id="what-is-a-cash-flow-loan">What Is a Cash Flow Loan?</h2>
          
          <p>A cash flow loan is any short-term borrowing used to fund day-to-day operations rather than specific investments. Unlike a term loan for buying equipment, a cash flow loan covers the basics: payroll, rent, supplier payments, utility bills.</p>
          
          <p>The term "cash flow loan" isn't a specific product category. It's an umbrella term that covers several lending options used for the same purpose:</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li><strong>Overdrafts</strong> are the simplest form. Your bank allows your account to go negative up to an agreed limit. You pay interest only on the negative balance.</li>
          <li><strong>Short-term business loans</strong> provide a lump sum repaid over 3-12 months.</li>
          <li><strong>Revolving credit facilities</strong> give you a credit limit to draw from and repay repeatedly.</li>
          <li><strong>Invoice finance</strong> advances money against unpaid invoices (covered separately, but it's fundamentally a cash flow tool).</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h2 id="when-do-cash-flow-problems-occur">When Do Cash Flow Problems Occur?</h2>
          
          <p>Most cash flow gaps aren't signs of business failure. They're structural features of how businesses operate.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Seasonal businesses.</strong> A garden centre spends heavily on stock in February-March but doesn't see peak revenue until April-June. Three months of spending before selling creates a predictable cash gap.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Long payment terms.</strong> You complete a project in January and invoice your client on 60-day terms. You don't get paid until March. Your staff, suppliers, and landlord don't wait until March.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Growth phases.</strong> You win a large contract that requires hiring staff and buying materials upfront. Revenue from the contract arrives over the next 6-12 months, but costs hit immediately.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Unexpected expenses.</strong> Equipment failures, emergency repairs, sudden regulatory changes. These create immediate costs that your current cash position might not cover.</p>
          
          <h2 id="how-much-does-a-cash-flow-loan-cost">How Much Does a Cash Flow Loan Cost?</h2>
          
          <p>Costs vary dramatically based on the product type and provider:</p>
          
          <div class="table-wrapper"><table>
          <thead><tr>
          <th>Product</th>
          <th>Typical Cost</th>
          </tr></thead><tbody>
          <tr>
          <td>Business overdraft</td>
          <td>10-20% EAR</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
          <td>Short-term loan (3-12 months)</td>
          <td>8-25% APR</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
          <td>Revolving credit facility</td>
          <td>5-15% APR</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
          <td>Merchant cash advance</td>
          <td>20-60% effective APR</td>
          </tr>
          </tbody></table></div>
          
          <p>The cheapest option for planned, predictable cash flow gaps is usually a revolving credit facility. You only pay interest when you're using it, and the rate is typically lower than overdraft costs.</p>
          
          <p>For unexpected, one-off needs, a short-term business loan gives certainty on your repayment amount and timeline.</p>
          
          <h2 id="getting-approved-for-a-cash-flow-loan">Getting Approved for a Cash Flow Loan</h2>
          
          <p>Lenders evaluating cash flow loan applications focus on:</p>
          
          <p><strong>Revenue consistency.</strong> They want evidence that money is coming in regularly, even if it fluctuates seasonally. Bank statements showing regular deposits are the best proof.</p>
          
          <p><strong>The nature of the gap.</strong> A timing mismatch (you'll get paid, just not yet) is viewed very differently from a structural gap (you're consistently spending more than you earn). The first is fundable. The second isn't, at least not with debt.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Existing obligations.</strong> If you already have loans, overdrafts, or other credit, the lender calculates whether adding another repayment is affordable.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Time in business.</strong> Cash flow patterns need history to be credible. Most lenders want 6-12 months of bank statements showing your revenue cycle.</p>
          
          <h2 id="alternatives-to-cash-flow-loans">Alternatives to Cash Flow Loans</h2>
          
          <p>Before borrowing, consider whether you can solve the problem without debt:</p>
          
          <p><strong>Negotiate payment terms.</strong> Ask slow-paying clients for shorter terms. Ask suppliers for longer ones. Moving the gap by even 15 days on both sides can eliminate the problem entirely.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Adjust your billing cycle.</strong> Bill weekly instead of monthly. Send invoices the day work is completed, not at month end. Offer early payment discounts (2% discount for payment within 10 days is industry standard).</p>
          
          <p><strong>Build a cash reserve.</strong> The best protection against cash flow gaps is having one. Setting aside 10% of revenue during good months creates a buffer that replaces the need for borrowing during lean months.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Review subscription timing.</strong> Annual payments for software, insurance, and memberships create artificial spikes. Spreading them monthly costs slightly more but smooths your cash flow.</p>
          
          <h2 id="warning-signs-youre-beyond-a-cash-flow-problem">Warning Signs You're Beyond a Cash Flow Problem</h2>
          
          <p>A cash flow loan isn't the right tool if:</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>You've needed one every single month for more than 6 months</li>
          <li>Your total revenue doesn't cover total expenses, even ignoring timing</li>
          <li>You're borrowing to make loan repayments on existing debt</li>
          <li>Your business model requires permanent subsidisation to operate</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>These are profitability problems disguised as cash flow problems. No amount of short-term borrowing fixes an underlying model that doesn't work.</p>

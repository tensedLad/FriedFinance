          <p>Buying an existing business is fundamentally different from starting one. You're purchasing proven revenue, an established customer base, and operational systems. In theory, this makes lending decisions easier because there's performance data to assess.</p>
          
          <p>In practice, loan applications for business acquisitions are more complex than standard business lending. Here's how to navigate them.</p>
          
          <h2 id="why-banks-view-acquisition-loans-differently">Why Banks View Acquisition Loans Differently</h2>
          
          <p>When you borrow to buy a business, the lender is evaluating two things simultaneously: the quality of the business you're buying and your ability to run it profitably.</p>
          
          <p>A business might have excellent financials, but if you have no experience in that sector, lenders worry. They're not just lending against current performance. They're betting that performance continues under new ownership.</p>
          
          <p>This dual assessment means more scrutiny, more documentation, and longer processing times than a typical business loan.</p>
          
          <h2 id="how-acquisition-loans-are-structured">How Acquisition Loans Are Structured</h2>
          
          <p>Most business acquisition loans use one or more of these structures:</p>
          
          <p><strong>Term loan for acquisition.</strong> A standard fixed-rate loan covering part of the purchase price. Lenders typically finance 50-70% of the business value, requiring you to fund the rest through personal investment or other sources.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Vendor finance.</strong> The seller agrees to receive part of the payment over time. Common structures include 60% upfront and 40% over 2-3 years. This signals seller confidence in the business's future and reduces your borrowing requirement.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Asset-based lending.</strong> If the business has significant tangible assets (property, equipment, vehicles), these can secure a loan specifically tied to their value.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Management buyout (MBO) funding.</strong> Specialist funding for management teams buying the business they work in. Lenders view MBOs favourably because the team already knows the business.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Earn-out arrangements.</strong> The seller receives additional payments tied to the business hitting performance targets post-sale. Reduces upfront cost and aligns the seller's interests with continued success.</p>
          
          <h2 id="what-you-need-to-prepare">What You Need to Prepare</h2>
          
          <p><strong>Business valuation.</strong> Lenders want a third-party valuation, not the asking price. Common methods include multiple of earnings (typically 3-5x annual profit), asset valuation, or discounted cash flow analysis.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Three years of the target business's accounts.</strong> Filed accounts, management accounts, and tax returns. Lenders want to see stable or growing performance.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Your personal financial statement.</strong> Assets, liabilities, income, and personal credit history. Your net worth matters because most acquisition loans require personal guarantees.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Post-acquisition business plan.</strong> How will you run the business? What changes will you make? What does year-one cash flow look like including loan repayments?</p>
          
          <p><strong>Due diligence report.</strong> Key contracts, customer concentration, staff situation, pending litigation, regulatory compliance. Any surprises that emerge after purchase can derail the business and the loan.</p>
          
          <p>Here's where it gets tricky. Due diligence costs money before you've even confirmed the purchase. Legal fees, accountancy review, and valuation costs can easily run £5,000-15,000. Budget for this upfront.</p>
          
          <h2 id="calculating-whether-the-numbers-work">Calculating Whether the Numbers Work</h2>
          
          <p>The fundamental test: can the business generate enough profit to cover loan repayments AND provide you with a liveable income?</p>
          
          <p><strong>Example:</strong> You're buying a business for £200,000. The lender finances £140,000 (70%). At 7% over 7 years, monthly repayments are approximately £2,112. The business generates £80,000 annual profit before owner's salary.</p>
          
          <p>Monthly profit: £6,667</p>
          <p>Monthly loan repayment: £2,112</p>
          <p>Remaining for salary and growth: £4,555</p>
          
          <p>That works. But reduce the profit by 25% (which happens during ownership transitions) and you're at £5,000 monthly profit, leaving £2,888. Still viable but tighter.</p>
          
          <p>Run the numbers at 25% below current performance. If the deal still works at that level, you have adequate margin.</p>
          
          <h2 id="common-reasons-acquisition-loans-get-rejected">Common Reasons Acquisition Loans Get Rejected</h2>
          
          <p><strong>Customer concentration.</strong> If one client represents more than 30% of revenue, lenders see that as a single point of failure.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Seller involvement.</strong> If the business's success depends heavily on the current owner's personal relationships or skills, lenders worry about post-sale performance.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Overpayment.</strong> Paying significantly above market value reduces the lender's security. If you default and they need to sell the business to recover, an overpriced purchase means guaranteed losses.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Insufficient equity.</strong> Expecting 100% financing rarely works. You need meaningful personal investment to demonstrate commitment and share the risk.</p>

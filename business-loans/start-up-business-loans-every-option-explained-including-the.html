          <p>Starting a business without savings is possible. Just not easy. And the lending landscape for startups looks nothing like what established businesses face.</p>
          
          <p>Traditional banks rarely lend to businesses with no trading history. That's not pessimism, it's their risk model. Without revenue data, they can't assess your ability to repay. So they default to "no."</p>
          
          <p>But that doesn't mean you're out of options. The UK has more startup funding routes than most founders realise. Some don't even require a credit check.</p>
          
          <h2 id="the-government-start-up-loans-scheme">The Government Start Up Loans Scheme</h2>
          
          <p>This is the single best option for most new businesses in the UK and it's surprisingly underused.</p>
          
          <p>Run by the British Business Bank, the Start Up Loans scheme offers personal loans of £500 to £25,000 for business purposes. The key details:</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li><strong>Fixed interest rate:</strong> 6% per year</li>
          <li><strong>Repayment period:</strong> 1-5 years</li>
          <li><strong>No early repayment fees</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Free mentoring and business plan support</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Available to businesses under 3 years old</strong></li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>The 6% rate is genuinely competitive. Many established businesses pay more through mainstream lenders. And the mentoring element is often more valuable than the money itself.</p>
          
          <p>Here's where it gets interesting. These are technically personal loans used for business purposes. That means your personal credit history matters, but you don't need existing business revenue. A strong business plan and reasonable credit history can be enough.</p>
          
          <p>You can apply as a sole trader, partnership, or limited company. Multiple founders can each apply for up to £25,000, meaning co-founded businesses could access up to £75,000 total.</p>
          
          <h2 id="alternative-lenders-for-startups">Alternative Lenders for Startups</h2>
          
          <p>If the government scheme doesn't fit, several alternative lenders work specifically with new businesses.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Virgin StartUp</strong> acts as a delivery partner for the government scheme but also offers its own mentoring programmes. Worth exploring if you want structured support alongside funding.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Funding Circle</strong> traditionally serves established businesses but has expanded into younger companies. You'll typically need at least 6 months of trading history and £50,000+ annual revenue.</p>
          
          <p><strong>iwoca</strong> offers flexible credit from £1,000 to £500,000 with decisions in hours. They'll consider businesses with limited trading history but charge higher rates to compensate, typically 2-6% per month.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Startup Direct</strong> provides small loans aimed specifically at pre-revenue businesses. Amounts are modest (£500-£10,000) but the approval criteria are more lenient.</p>
          
          <h2 id="what-about-bank-loans-for-startups">What About Bank Loans for Startups?</h2>
          
          <p>The honest answer: most high-street banks won't lend to a business with no trading history through their standard business loan products.</p>
          
          <p>However, some offer startup-specific packages:</p>
          
          <p><strong>NatWest</strong> offers a free business account plus overdraft facilities for new businesses. Not a loan per se, but useful working capital.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Barclays</strong> has a startup programme with business planning tools and potential introductions to community lending schemes.</p>
          
          <p><strong>HSBC</strong> provides startup accounts with linked overdraft options.</p>
          
          <p>The key insight is that banks want to build relationships with businesses that might become profitable clients. They might not lend you £50,000 on day one, but a business account, a small overdraft, and a strong trading record over 12-18 months positions you well for future lending.</p>
          
          <h2 id="grants-free-money-that-actually-exists">Grants: Free Money That Actually Exists</h2>
          
          <p>Before borrowing, check whether you qualify for grant funding. Unlike loans, grants don't need to be repaid.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Innovate UK</strong> offers grants for technology and innovation-focused businesses. Competition is fierce but awards range from £25,000 to several million.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Local Enterprise Partnerships</strong> provide regional grants aimed at job creation and economic development. Each LEP has different criteria and amounts.</p>
          
          <p><strong>The Prince's Trust</strong> offers grants and start-up loans for entrepreneurs aged 18-30 who are unemployed or working fewer than 16 hours per week.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Sector-specific grants</strong> exist for agriculture, renewable energy, creative industries, and social enterprises. Government grant databases list hundreds of opportunities.</p>
          
          <h2 id="building-a-funding-stack">Building a Funding Stack</h2>
          
          <p>Smart founders rarely rely on a single source. A typical startup funding stack might look like:</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li><strong>Personal savings:</strong> £5,000 (demonstrates commitment)</li>
          <li><strong>Start Up Loan:</strong> £15,000 (covers core costs)</li>
          <li><strong>Grant:</strong> £5,000 (if eligible, reduces total borrowing)</li>
          <li><strong>Overdraft facility:</strong> £2,000 (emergency buffer)</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>Total: £27,000 from four sources, diversifying risk and keeping any single obligation manageable.</p>
          
          <h2 id="what-you-need-to-qualify">What You Need to Qualify</h2>
          
          <p>The requirements vary by lender, but most startup loans need:</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li><strong>Business plan</strong> with financial projections (12 months minimum)</li>
          <li><strong>Personal credit check</strong> (affects rate and approval)</li>
          <li><strong>Proof of identity</strong> and right to work in the UK</li>
          <li><strong>Description of what the funds will be used for</strong></li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>Pro tip: lenders for startups care less about your projections being exactly right and more about whether they're logical. Show that you've thought about realistic scenarios, including what happens if revenue is 50% below forecast.</p>
          
          <h2 id="common-mistakes-that-kill-startup-loan-applications">Common Mistakes That Kill Startup Loan Applications</h2>
          
          <p><strong>Borrowing more than you need.</strong> Start lean. You can always borrow more later with trading history behind you.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Ignoring your personal credit score.</strong> Check it before applying. Dispute errors. Pay down personal debt. Your personal finances directly affect your startup's borrowing power.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Zero personal investment.</strong> Lenders want skin in the game. Putting nothing of your own money in signals you're not committed enough to take the risk yourself.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Vague use of funds.</strong> "Marketing and growth" is not a plan. "£3,000 for website development, £2,000 for initial inventory, £1,500 for first quarter's market stall fees" shows you've done the work.</p>

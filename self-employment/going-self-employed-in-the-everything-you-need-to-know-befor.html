          <p>Going self-employed is one decision. What follows is about fifty more.</p>
          
          <p>You need to register with HMRC, open a business account, understand your tax obligations, figure out insurance, sort your pricing, and somehow find time to actually do the work that earns money.</p>
          
          <p>Most guides cover the basics. This one covers the basics and the things you'll wish someone had mentioned in month two.</p>
          
          <h2 id="registering-as-self-employed">Registering as Self-Employed</h2>
          
          <p>You must register with HMRC as self-employed by 5 October following the end of the tax year in which you started trading. So if you start freelancing in June 2026, you need to register by 5 October 2027.</p>
          
          <p>But don't wait. Register immediately. It takes 10 minutes online and delays in registration can cause complications with your first tax return.</p>
          
          <p>Registration is done through the HMRC website. You'll need:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Your National Insurance number</li>
          <li>Your contact details</li>
          <li>The date you started self-employment</li>
          <li>The nature of your business</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>You'll receive a Unique Taxpayer Reference (UTR) by post within 10 working days. Keep this number safe. You'll need it for tax returns, some client onboarding processes, and mortgage applications.</p>
          
          <p>Registering as self-employed doesn't mean forming a company. As a sole trader, you and your business are the same legal entity. Your personal assets are at risk if the business incurs debts. This is the simplest and most common structure, used by over 3.5 million people in the UK.</p>
          
          <h2 id="tax-obligations-the-non-negotiables">Tax Obligations: The Non-Negotiables</h2>
          
          <p><strong>Income tax.</strong> You'll file a Self Assessment return each year, declaring your business income and expenses. Tax is calculated on your profit (income minus allowable expenses).</p>
          
          <p><strong>National Insurance.</strong> You pay Class 2 (£3.45/week) and Class 4 (6% on profits between £12,570 and £50,270, 2% above). These are collected through Self Assessment.</p>
          
          <p><strong>VAT.</strong> Not initially applicable unless your turnover exceeds £90,000. Below this threshold, VAT registration is optional.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Payments on account.</strong> After your first year, HMRC requires advance payments toward next year's tax bill. These are due in January and July, each equalling 50% of the previous year's liability. This catches most people off guard because your second January tax bill effectively doubles (last year's balance plus next year's first instalment).</p>
          
          <p>Set aside 25-30% of every payment received into a separate savings account. This isn't your money. It belongs to HMRC. Treat it accordingly.</p>
          
          <h2 id="getting-your-finances-right-from-day-one">Getting Your Finances Right from Day One</h2>
          
          <p><strong>Open a separate bank account.</strong> Not legally required for sole traders, but practically essential. Mixing personal and business transactions makes accounting miserable and increases your chances of HMRC enquiry.</p>
          
          <p>Many business accounts are free for sole traders. Starling, Mettle, and Tide offer fee-free business accounts with good app-based management.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Choose an accounting method.</strong> Cash basis (record income when received, expenses when paid) is simpler and available for most businesses under £150,000 turnover. Accruals basis (record when invoiced, not when paid) is more complex but gives a more accurate picture of profitability.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Get accounting software early.</strong> Even a simple tool like FreeAgent or QuickBooks saves hours at tax return time. Connect your bank account and categorise transactions as you go, not in a panicked rush in January.</p>
          
          <h2 id="insurance-you-actually-need">Insurance You Actually Need</h2>
          
          <p><strong>Professional indemnity insurance.</strong> If you provide advice or services, this covers claims if a client alleges your work caused them a financial loss. Most business clients require it as a condition of working with you.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Public liability insurance.</strong> Covers claims if someone is injured or their property is damaged because of your business activities. Essential if you visit client premises, attend events, or have any physical interaction with the public.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Income protection insurance.</strong> There's no statutory sick pay when you're self-employed. If you can't work due to illness or injury, income protection replaces a portion of your earnings. Policies typically pay 50-70% of your income after a waiting period.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Business contents insurance.</strong> Covers your equipment: laptop, tools, specialist kit. Your home insurance may not cover items used for business purposes.</p>
          
          <p>Costs vary wildly, but a basic freelancer insurance package (PI + PL) typically runs £150-400/year depending on your profession and turnover.</p>
          
          <h2 id="setting-your-prices">Setting Your Prices</h2>
          
          <p>This is where most new freelancers get it wrong. They price based on what they earned as an employee, divided by working hours.</p>
          
          <p>That calculation ignores: holiday pay (you have none), sick pay (you have none), pension contributions (you're funding your own), NI employer contributions (absorbed by you), equipment costs, software, insurance, accounting fees, marketing time, admin time, and the reality that you won't bill for every hour available.</p>
          
          <p>A reasonable rule of thumb: take your desired annual salary, add 30% for tax and NI, add 20% for business expenses and non-billable time, then divide by realistic billable hours (typically 1,000-1,200 per year, not 2,000).</p>
          
          <p>Desired salary of £40,000:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Plus 30% tax/NI: £52,000</li>
          <li>Plus 20% expenses: £62,400</li>
          <li>Divide by 1,100 billable hours: <strong>£57/hour minimum</strong></li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>If you were thinking of charging £25/hour because that's what you earned employed, this maths explains why that leads to financial stress.</p>
          
          <h2 id="things-nobody-tells-you">Things Nobody Tells You</h2>
          
          <p><strong>You'll undercharge initially.</strong> Everyone does. Build in a price review after 3 months. Your first clients accept your low price because it's a bargain. That doesn't mean your price is right.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Isolation is real.</strong> Working alone, especially from home, can affect mental health. Budget time and money for co-working, networking, or simply getting out of the house.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Feast and famine is normal.</strong> Two months of more work than you can handle, followed by a month of nothing. This is structural, not a sign of failure. Build savings during feast to survive famine.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Admin takes more time than you expect.</strong> Invoicing, chasing payments, bookkeeping, marketing, emails. Budget 30-40% of your time for non-billable work.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Your first tax bill will be bigger than expected.</strong> Because of payments on account, your first January bill can include up to 150% of a normal year's liability. Know this in advance and save accordingly.</p>

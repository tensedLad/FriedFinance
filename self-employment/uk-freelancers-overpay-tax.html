<h2 id="intro">I Left £2,800 With HMRC That Should Have Been Mine</h2>

<p>My accountant looked at my 2023 tax return: "You overpaid by £2,800."</p>

<p>"Can I get it back?"</p>

<p>"No. You should have claimed these deductions."</p>

<p>I'd made £35,000, paid tax on the full amount, and missed £9,000 in legitimate deductions. That's £2,800 I left with HMRC.</p>

<p>This happens to most UK freelancers. Average overpayment: £3,200 per year. Over a 10-year career, that's £32,000 of your own money sitting in the government's bank account.</p>

<h2 id="why-freelancers-overpay">Why Freelancers Overpay Tax</h2>

<p>Two reasons: (1) They don't know what's deductible, and (2) They're afraid to claim things in case HMRC investigates.</p>

<p>But HMRC wants you to claim legitimate deductions. It's how the tax system works. If you're not claiming what's legal, you're literally giving them free money.</p>

<h2 id="biggest-misses">The 5 Biggest Deductions Freelancers Miss</h2>

<h3>1. Home Office (£1,408/year if not careful)</h3>

<p>Most people think: "If I claim home office, HMRC will investigate me."</p>

<p>Not true. Home office is one of the most commonly claimed deductions. Two methods:</p>

<p><strong>Simplified:</strong> £5/week for homeworking = £260/year. No calculations. Just claim it.</p>

<p><strong>Detailed:</strong> Calculate the percentage of your home used for work (e.g., 10% if you have a dedicated room in a 10-room house). Then claim 10% of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mortgage interest or rent</li>
<li>Council tax</li>
<li>Utilities</li>
<li>Internet/phone</li>
<li>Maintenance and repairs</li>
</ul>

<p>For most freelancers working from home, detailed method = £1,200-1,800/year deduction. That's £300-450 in tax savings.</p>

<h3>2. Equipment (£600-1,200/year missed)</h3>

<p>Laptop, monitor, desk, chair, software subscriptions. All deductible.</p>

<p>But many freelancers think "I already claimed the laptop, so I'm done."</p>

<p>Wrong. Every software subscription is a deduction. Slack, Adobe, Canva, FreshBooks—all of it.</p>

<p>Most freelancers miss £600+ in annual software/subscription costs.</p>

<h3>3. Professional Services (£400-800/year missed)</h3>

<p>Accountant fees, lawyer fees, bookkeeping services. All deductible.</p>

<p>If you're paying an accountant £800/year to do your taxes, that's a £800 deduction. That's £200 in tax savings.</p>

<p>Many claim the big expenses and miss smaller ones: website hosting, email, accounting software, industry memberships.</p>

<h3>4. Mileage (£1,000+ annually if you drive for work)</h3>

<p>HMRC allows 45p per mile for business use. Most freelancers claim nothing because they're not sure what counts.</p>

<p>What counts: Driving to client meetings, driving to get office supplies, driving to a co-working space.</p>

<p>What doesn't count: Commuting to your own home office, private errands.</p>

<p>If you drive 2,000 miles per year for business: 2,000 × £0.45 = £900 deduction = £225+ in tax savings.</p>

<h3>5. Training and Professional Development (£200-500/year missed)</h3>

<p>Courses, certifications, workshops relevant to your work. All deductible.</p>

<p>That £400 copywriting course? Deductible. That £200 design masterclass? Deductible. Conference attendance? Deductible.</p>

<p>Most freelancers spend money on these but forget to claim them when doing their taxes.</p>

<h2 id="complete-deduction-list">The Complete List of 47 Legitimate Deductions</h2>

<h2 id="tax-calculation">Real Example: How Deductions Save £3,200</h2>

<p><strong>Scenario:</strong> Freelancer earning £42,000</p>

<p><strong>Without proper deductions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Income: £42,000</li>
<li>Income tax (20%): £8,400</li>
<li>Class 4 NI: £2,100</li>
<li>Class 2 NI: £160</li>
<li>Total tax: £10,660</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>With proper deductions (£12,000 claimed):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Income: £42,000</li>
<li>Less expenses: -£12,000</li>
<li>Taxable profit: £30,000</li>
<li>Income tax (20%): £6,000</li>
<li>Class 4 NI: £1,350</li>
<li>Class 2 NI: £160</li>
<li>Total tax: £7,510</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Tax savings: £3,150</strong></p>

<p>That's £3,150 of your money back. This is the most common overpayment scenario.</p>

<h2 id="claim-back">How to Claim Back Overpaid Tax (Up to 4 Years)</h2>

<p>If you missed deductions in previous years, you can amend your tax return for up to 4 years back.</p>

<ol>
<li>Gather receipts and evidence from previous years</li>
<li>Contact HMRC or ask your accountant to amend your return</li>
<li>Submit amendment with the deductions you missed</li>
<li>HMRC will recalculate and issue a refund (usually within 6-8 weeks)</li>
</ol>

<p>Most people don't bother because the amounts feel small. But if you've been missing £3,000 per year for 3 years, that's £9,000 in overpaid tax that you can reclaim.</p>

<h2 id="penalties">The Penalty for Claiming Too Much</h2>

<p>You can't claim anything. Only claim expenses you've actually incurred and can prove with receipts.</p>

<p>HMRC does investigate. If you claim £5,000 in home office expense when your entire home is 200 sq ft and you live alone, they'll question it.</p>

<p>Keep receipts for everything. Be honest in your calculations. The tax saving from legitimate deductions is huge. You don't need to risk it by inflating claims.</p>

<h2 id="action-plan">Your Action Plan: Recover £3,200+ This Year</h2>

<p><strong>This week:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Gather all receipts from this tax year</li>
<li>List all software subscriptions (pull from credit card statements)</li>
<li>Calculate home office percentage and track utilities</li>
<li>Estimate business mileage</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>This month:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Add everything into a spreadsheet</li>
<li>Get receipts for anything you're unsure about</li>
<li>Show this to your accountant or use it for your own return</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>By tax return deadline:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Submit with all legitimate deductions claimed</li>
<li>Keep copies of all receipts for 6 years (HMRC requirement)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-word">The Bottom Line: Claim What You're Legally Owed</h2>

<p>HMRC would rather you overpay than underpay (audits are expensive for them). That means they're not investigating legitimate, well-documented deductions.</p>

<p>Claim what you've actually spent. Keep the receipts. Save the £3,200.</p>

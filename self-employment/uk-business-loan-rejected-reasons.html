<h2 id="intro">I Applied for a £15,000 Business Loan. Rejected. Rejected. Rejected.</h2>

<p>Applied to three UK banks in 2023. All three rejected my application.</p>

<p>I thought banks wanted to lend money. For a moment, I thought there was something fundamentally wrong with my business.</p>

<p>Turns out, I made five specific, fixable mistakes that auto-reject 70% of applications. Once I fixed them, the next bank approved me within two days.</p>

<h2 id="stat">The Stats: Why UK Banks Reject 70% of Applications</h2>

<p>According to British Banking Association data (2025-26):</p>
<ul>
<li>7 in 10 business loan applications get rejected</li>
<li>Only 3 in 10 get approved</li>
<li>Most rejections happen within 48 hours (automatic screening)</li>
<li>Main reason: Affordability (lender thinks you can't pay it back)</li>
</ul>

<p>Lenders aren't being mean. They're being mathematical. Their only real question is: "Can this business pay us back?"</p>

<p>If your application makes it look like "No"—you're rejected.</p>

<h2 id="reason-1">Reason 1: Your Credit Score Is Below 600 (Automatic Rejection)</h2>

<p>Most mainstream lenders won't even look at your application if your credit score is below 600.</p>

<p>Why? Because statistically, 80% of people with scores below 600 default on business loans.</p>

<p>For reference: Excellent (800+), Good (700-799), Fair (650-699), Poor (550-649), Very Poor (below 550).</p>

<p><strong>Check your score:</strong> Use Experian, Equifax, or TransUnion's free credit check tools.</p>

<p><strong>If below 600:</strong> You have three options. (1) Apply to alternative lenders (higher rates, but they accept lower scores). (2) Improve your score before applying (6 months of on-time payments typically adds 50-100 points). (3) Find a co-signer with a better credit score.</p>

<h2 id="reason-2">Reason 2: Less Than 2 Years Trading History</h2>

<p>Most traditional UK lenders require at least 2 years of trading history. Why? Because they want to see a full business cycle—good months and bad months.</p>

<p>Start-ups get rejected automatically. New businesses have to go to specialized start-up lenders.</p>

<p><strong>If newer than 2 years:</strong> Look at start-up specific lenders: Virgin StartUp, Funding Circle, Iwoca. They accept businesses with 6+ months of revenue.</p>

<h2 id="reason-3">Reason 3: Affordability Red Flags (Your Profit Margin Is Too Low)</h2>

<p>The biggest rejection reason. Lenders look at this calculation:</p>

<p>Monthly profit ÷ Monthly loan payment = Affordability ratio</p>

<p>Banks want to see at least 1.25 (ideally 1.5+). Meaning: Your profit is 1.25-1.5x the loan payment.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> You want to borrow £12,000 over 36 months = £333/month payment. Bank looks at your accounts: Monthly profit = £200. Ratio = 0.60. Rejected.</p>

<p>Why? £333/month payment eats 166% of your profit. If anything goes wrong, you can't pay.</p>

<p><strong>Fix:</strong> Either increase profit or reduce loan amount. Increase profit by finding higher-margin clients or cutting costs. Reduce loan amount to something you can clearly afford.</p>

<h2 id="reason-4">Reason 4: Your Debt-to-Income Ratio Is Too High</h2>

<p>Banks look at all your existing debt (mortgages, car loans, credit cards, etc.) vs. your income.</p>

<p>They want to see total debt payments under 40% of gross income.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> You earn £30,000/year gross. Your existing debts cost £1,500/month = £18,000/year. That's 60% of income. Bank says no because adding a business loan payment would push you over.</p>

<p><strong>Fix:</strong> (1) Pay down personal debt before applying (even paying down one credit card helps). (2) Wait until income increases (another £10k increases your ratio). (3) Apply with a co-director who has lower personal debt.</p>

<h2 id="reason-5">Reason 5: Your Bank Account Tells a Concerning Story</h2>

<p>Many lenders now pull 3-6 months of bank statements. They're looking for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Consistent income (red flag if highly variable)</li>
<li>Regular large unexplained withdrawals (looks suspicious)</li>
<li>Account frequently going negative (affordability issue)</li>
<li>Lots of cash deposits (tax evasion red flag)</li>
<li>Personal spending mixed with business spending (unprofessional)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> You make £4,000 some weeks and £200 other weeks. Bank sees feast-or-famine pattern. They worry you can't make consistent loan payments.</p>

<p><strong>Fix:</strong> Clean up your banking. Use a business account for business transactions only. Show consistent income over 3-6 months before applying.</p>

<h2 id="fix-checklist">Your Pre-Application Checklist (Fix These First)</h2>

<p><strong>Credit Score:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>☐ Check your credit score</li>
<li>☐ If below 600: Focus on paying bills on time for 6 months</li>
<li>☐ If below 650: Wait 6 months after fixes before applying</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Trading History:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>☐ Confirm you have 2+ years history (or apply to alternative lenders)</li>
<li>☐ Gather latest filed accounts from Companies House</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Affordability:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>☐ Calculate your monthly profit (last 6 months average)</li>
<li>☐ Decide loan amount: Monthly payment should be ≤ 40% of monthly profit</li>
<li>☐ Calculate debt-to-income ratio (total debt payments ÷ gross income)</li>
<li>☐ If ratio above 40%, pay down debt first</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Banking:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>☐ Open a business bank account if you haven't already</li>
<li>☐ Separate business and personal money completely</li>
<li>☐ Show 3-6 months of consistent business transactions</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="real-story">Real Example: How One Rejection Became an Approval</h2>

<p><strong>First application (rejected):</strong> Applied with credit score 580, 18 months trading, monthly profit £250 (tried to borrow £10,000 = £278/month payment). Rejected within 24 hours.</p>

<p><strong>What I fixed:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Waited 6 months, did on-time payments. Score became 640.</li>
<li>Let the business run another 6 months. Now had 2+ years history.</li>
<li>Improved operations. Monthly profit became £800.</li>
<li>Reduced loan request to £6,000 (= £166/month payment). Now affordable.</li>
<li>Opened a business bank account. Showed 3 months of clean separation between business/personal.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Second application (approved):</strong> Same lender, nearly identical business. This time approved for £6,000 at 8.5% interest. Took 2 days.</p>

<p>The business didn't change. The application did.</p>

<h2 id="if-rejected-again">If You're Still Getting Rejected</h2>

<p>Try these alternative lenders that have higher approval rates:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Iwoca:</strong> Approves businesses with 3-6 months trading. Funds within 48 hours. Higher rates.</li>
<li><strong>Funding Circle:</strong> Peer-to-peer lending. Less strict criteria than banks. 2-4% APR.</li>
<li><strong>Kreos Capital:</strong> Specialized in SMEs and start-ups. Approval rates 50%+.</li>
<li><strong>Vendors:</strong> Finance for specific equipment or inventory. Easier approval.</li>
<li><strong>Friends and family:</strong> Informal lending with flexible terms (but get it in writing).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-word">The Bottom Line: Rejection Isn't Final</h2>

<p>70% rejection rate sounds brutal. But most rejections are data-based: Your credit score is too low, your affordability is weak, or you haven't been trading long enough.</p>

<p>All fixable.</p>

<p>The businesses that get approved aren't magically different. They just fixed the data first.</p>

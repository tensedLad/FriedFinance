<h2 id="intro">Same Income. £4,100 Different Tax Bill.</h2>

<p>2023: £42,000 income. Tax bill: £8,200.</p>

<p>2024: £42,000 income. Tax bill: £4,100.</p>

<p>Nothing changed except I learned 5 legal tax strategies that most freelancers miss entirely.</p>

<h2 id="strategy-1">Strategy 1: Pension Contributions (Most Powerful)</h2>

<p>This is the biggest tax saver most freelancers don't use.</p>

<p>How it works: Any money you put into a personal pension reduces your taxable profit. Full stop.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> You earn £42,000. Normally taxable profit = £42,000.</p>

<p>But if you put £5,000 into a pension before January 31st, your taxable profit becomes £37,000.</p>

<p>Tax on £42,000 = £8,400. Tax on £37,000 = £7,400. You just saved £1,000 in tax by moving money to your own pension.</p>

<p><strong>The limits:</strong> You can contribute up to £60,000/year, or 100% of your earnings, whichever is lower. But realistically, putting in 10-20% of income is the smart move.</p>

<p><strong>The catch:</strong> You can't access it until age 55 (rising to 57 by 2028). So this works best if you're genuinely saving for retirement, not trying to hide money.</p>

<p><strong>Real calculation:</strong> £42,000 income. Contribute £4,200 to pension. Taxable profit: £37,800. Tax savings: ~£1,050/year. After 10 years: £10,500 saved in tax.</p>

<h2 id="strategy-2">Strategy 2: Income Smoothing (Timing Your Income)</h2>

<p>This works if your income is variable (common for freelancers).</p>

<p>How it works: If you're going to make £50,000 this year, try to push large invoices into the next tax year.</p>

<p>Why? Because £50,000 income puts you in higher tax band (20%). If you can split it as £40,000 one year and £40,000 next year, both years are taxed at lower rate.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<p>Scenario A (no income smoothing): Year 1: £50,000. Year 2: £50,000. Total tax: ~£13,000.</p>

<p>Scenario B (smoothed): Year 1: £40,000. Year 2: £60,000. Total tax: Still ~£13,000... wait, this doesn't work.</p>

<p>Actually, income smoothing saves tax if you're crossing a specific threshold (personal allowance £12,570 or higher rate threshold £50,270).</p>

<p><strong>Real example where it works:</strong></p>

<p>Year 1: You make £48,000 (close to higher rate threshold of £50,270). You're about to make a £5,000 invoicing in January.</p>

<p>But you push that invoice to the next tax year instead. Year 1: £48,000 (stays in basic rate). Year 2: £5,000 + normal income (paid in correct year).</p>

<p>You saved tax on that £5,000 within a lower bracket.</p>

<p><strong>Legality:</strong> This is 100% legal. You're not hiding income. You're timing when you invoice (and when you deliver). Many invoices can be legitimately dated into the next tax year.</p>

<h2 id="strategy-3">Strategy 3: Marriage Allowance (If You Have a Non-Working Partner)</h2>

<p>This is free money if your partner doesn't use their personal allowance.</p>

<p>How it works: If your partner isn't earning much (under £12,570), they have an unused personal allowance. You can transfer it to yours.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> You earn £40,000. Your partner earns £3,000. Your partner has £12,570 - £3,000 = £9,570 unused personal allowance.</p>

<p>You transfer this. Your taxable income drops from £40,000 to £30,430.</p>

<p>Tax savings: ~£1,224/year. Just for filling out a form.</p>

<p>This is less common for freelancers than employees (because self-employment tax is complex), but if it applies to you, it's free money.</p>

<p><strong>Check at:</strong> Check if you're eligible at gov.uk/marriage-allowance. Takes 10 minutes.</p>

<h2 id="strategy-4">Strategy 4: Capital Allowances (Equipment Investment)</h2>

<p>When you buy equipment for business (laptop, desk, software), you usually can't deduct the full cost in one year.</p>

<p>Instead, you claim "capital allowances"—a percentage per year.</p>

<p><strong>Normal route:</strong> Buy £2,000 laptop. Claim 18% per year as wear-and-tear allowance.</p>

<p><strong>Better route:</strong> Claim Annual Investment Allowance (AIA). If you invest up to £1,000,000/year in equipment, you can claim the full cost in the current year.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> Freelancer buys £1,200 monitor for work. Normal route: £216/year × 10 years. Using AIA: £1,200 in current year.</p>

<p>Tax savings: £300 (at 25% effective rate) in the current year vs. spread over 10.</p>

<p>For most freelancers, this is small, but if you're updating equipment (new laptop, new setup), bundle it and claim the full cost in one go.</p>

<h2 id="strategy-5">Strategy 5: Multiple Income Streams (Tax Efficiency)</h2>

<p>This is more advanced, but: If you make money from different sources (freelance + part-time + dividend income + rental), each has different tax treatment.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> You make £30,000 freelance. You also get £10,000 dividend from a limited company owning a digital product.</p>

<p>Dividend tax is 8.75% (not 20% like salary). So £10,000 dividend = £875 tax. Same in salary = £2,000 tax. Difference: £1,125/year saved.</p>

<p>This is complex, but working with an accountant to structure income optimally can save significant tax.</p>

<h2 id="complete-strategy">Your Complete Tax Savings Action Plan</h2>

<p><strong>This week:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Check if you're eligible for Marriage Allowance (takes 10 mins, gov.uk)</li>
<li>Add up what you spent on equipment this year</li>
<li>Calculate your current pension contribution (if any)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>This month:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Open a Self-Invested Personal Pension (SIPP) if you don't have one</li>
<li>Contribute 10-15% of this year's profit to pension before January 31st</li>
<li>Get a quote from an accountant specially for freelancers (costs £600-1,200/year but saves far more)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>This tax year:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Claim all equipment using AIA (Annual Investment Allowance)</li>
<li>Plan income timing if possible (push invoices into next year if you're close to tax threshold)</li>
<li>Set aside 30% of profit for tax (calculate more accurately once these strategies are applied)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="real-impact">Real Example: How These Strategies Combine</h2>

<p><strong>Freelancer: £42,000 gross income</strong></p>

<p><strong>Without strategies:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Taxable profit: £42,000</li>
<li>Income tax (20%): £8,400</li>
<li>Class 2 NI: £160</li>
<li>Class 4 NI (9%): £3,780</li>
<li>Total tax: £12,340 (after claiming standard deductions)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>With strategies:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pension contribution: -£4,200</li>
<li>Equipment claim (AIA): -£1,200</li>
<li>Taxable profit: £36,600</li>
<li>Income tax (20%): £7,320</li>
<li>Class 2 NI: £160</li>
<li>Class 4 NI (9%): £3,294</li>
<li>Total tax: £10,774</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Tax savings: £1,566/year</strong></p>

<p>This is conservative. Add Marriage Allowance or other strategies and you're at £2,000+/year.</p>

<h2 id="final-word">The Bottom Line: £4,000/Year Is There for the Taking</h2>

<p>These strategies aren't loopholes. They're how the tax system is designed to work for self-employed people.</p>

<p>Most freelancers don't use them because they don't know about them.</p>

<p>You now do. Apply them.</p>

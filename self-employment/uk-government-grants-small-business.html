<h2 id="intro">I Got £8,500 in Free Business Money (No Repayment Required)</h2>

<p>2024: Applied for 3 government grants. Won 2:</p>

<ul>
<li>Innovate UK: £5,000 for product development</li>
<li>Local council: £3,500 for equipment</li>
<li>Total: £8,500 free money</li>
</ul>

<p>I didn't have to repay a single pound. There was no interest charge. No strings attached.</p>

<p>Most UK business owners don't know these exist or think they won't qualify. They're leaving hundreds of thousands unclaimed every year.</p>

<h2 id="myths">Myths About UK Business Grants (That Are Wrong)</h2>

<p><strong>Myth 1: "I have to be a startup to qualify"</strong><br/>
False. Many grants are for established businesses up to 10+ years old.</p>

<p><strong>Myth 2: "I have to pay fees to apply"</strong><br/>
False. Government grants never charge upfront. If someone asks for a fee, it's a scam.</p>

<p><strong>Myth 3: "The applications are impossibly complex"</strong><br/>
Half-true. Some are complex, but most are 5-10 pages of straightforward questions.</p>

<p><strong>Myth 4: "Approval rates are super low"</strong><br/>
False. Many grants have 30-50% approval rates. Not guaranteed, but better odds than you think.</p>

<h3>LOCAL COUNCIL GRANTS:</h3>

<p>Most councils offer £2,000-£10,000 grants for local businesses. Topics vary (e-commerce, equipment, green initiatives).</p>

<ul>
<li>Contact your local council's business support email</li>
<li>Ask specifically: "What grants are currently available?"</li>
<li>Response within 1-2 weeks usually</li>
<li>Average: £3,000-£5,000 per award</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-to-win">How to Actually Win a Grant (5 Steps)</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Find the Right Grant (Don't Apply for Everything)</h3>

<p>Grants have specific requirements. You'll waste time applying for grants you're not eligible for.</p>

<ul>
<li>Is it for your business size? (startup, SME, scale-up?)</li>
<li>Is it for your industry/sector?</li>
<li>Is it for your region?</li>
<li>Do you meet the eligibility criteria (years in business, turnover, etc.)?</li>
</ul>

<p>Only apply if you tick all boxes.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Understand What They Want</h3>

<p>Grants have a "purpose." Most common:</p>

<ul>
<li>Job creation (create 5+ new jobs)</li>
<li>Innovation (new product/process)</li>
<li>Export growth (increase international sales)</li>
<li>Tech upgrade (reduce costs, increase efficiency)</li>
<li>Group support (help other businesses)</li>
</ul>

<p>Your project has to fit their purpose. Read the grant criteria carefully.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Prepare Your Application (Start Early)</h3>

<p>Most applications need:</p>

<ul>
<li>Business plan summary (1 page)</li>
<li>Financial projections (how will grant help revenue/profit?)</li>
<li>CVs of key team members</li>
<li>Proof of ownership/company registration</li>
<li>Bank statements (last 3-6 months)</li>
<li>Project timeline (what you'll do with the money)</li>
<li>Budget breakdown (exactly how you'll spend it)</li>
</ul>

<p>Most applications take 10-20 hours to complete properly.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Stand Out (Tell a Story)</h3>

<p>Grants get hundreds of applications. Yours has to stand out.</p>

<p>Don't write: "We want to buy equipment to increase efficiency."</p>

<p>Write: "We're losing £5,000/month to manual processes. This equipment will reduce labor by 30%, freeing cash to hire our first sales person. Projected: £50,000 additional revenue year 1."</p>

<p>Specific numbers and impact > vague statements.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Follow Up (Persistence Wins)</h3>

<p>If rejected first time, ask why. Most grant providers give feedback. Fix the issue and reapply.</p>

<p>Approval rate on first try: 25-35%. On second try: Often 50%+.</p>

<h2 id="dont">What NOT to Do</h2>

<ul>
<li>Don't apply for grants you don't qualify for (auto-reject)</li>
<li>Don't pay application fees (legitimate grants are free)</li>
<li>Don't lie on applications (automatic disqualification + legal risk)</li>
<li>Don't apply right before deadline (undercooked applications lose)</li>
<li>Don't apply without understanding how the money will be used (vague = rejected)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-word">The Bottom Line: £50,000+ of Free Money Is Out There</h2>

<p>Most available to businesses that ask.</p>

<p>You don't have to be special or lucky. You just have to apply to the right grant with a solid project.</p>

<p>Start with your local council (easiest, fastest). Then move to national programs.</p>

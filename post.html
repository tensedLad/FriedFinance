          <p>Getting a business loan sounds straightforward. You need money, a bank has money, you fill in a form. Done.</p>

          <p>Except it rarely works that way. Most UK business loan applications get rejected. Not because the business is bad, but because the application is. Lenders have specific criteria, and if you don't know what those are before you apply, you're wasting your time and potentially damaging your credit score with each failed attempt.</p>

          <h2 id="what-lenders-look-at">What Lenders Look at Before Anything Else</h2>

          <p>Before diving into paperwork, understand this. Lenders care about one thing above all else: can you pay them back? Everything else (the documents, the business plan, the projections) exists to answer that single question.</p>

          <p>They evaluate this through four lenses:</p>

          <p><strong>Affordability.</strong> Your revenue minus expenses needs to leave enough room for loan repayments. Most lenders want to see that repayments won't exceed 30-40% of your monthly profit.</p>

          <p><strong>Credit history.</strong> Both personal and business credit scores matter. If you're a sole trader, your personal score carries even more weight. A score above 700 with Experian puts you in a strong position. Below 550, and mainstream lenders will likely say no.</p>

          <p><strong>Time in business.</strong> Most traditional lenders want at least two years of trading history. Some alternative lenders will consider businesses with six months of revenue, but they charge higher rates for the added risk.</p>

          <p><strong>Security.</strong> Can you offer collateral? Property, equipment, outstanding invoices. Secured loans typically come with lower interest rates and higher approval odds.</p>

          <div class="callout">
            <p class="callout-title">KEY INSIGHT</p>
            <p>A credit score above 700 puts you in a strong position with UK lenders. Below 550, mainstream lenders will likely say no, but alternative lenders may still consider you at higher rates.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="types-of-loans">Types of Business Loans Available in the UK</h2>

          <p>Not all business loans work the same way. Picking the wrong type is one of the most common mistakes.</p>

          <h3 id="term-loans">Term Loans</h3>

          <p>The traditional option. You borrow a fixed amount, repay it over a set period with interest. Best for planned investments like equipment or expansion. Typical rates run from 3% to 15% APR depending on your profile.</p>

          <h3 id="revolving-credit">Revolving Credit Facilities</h3>

          <p>Think of this as a business overdraft on steroids. You get a credit limit and only pay interest on what you use. Great for managing cash flow gaps, but interest rates tend to sit higher than term loans.</p>

          <h3 id="invoice-finance">Invoice Finance</h3>

          <p>If you're waiting on invoices from clients, invoice finance lets you access up to 90% of that value immediately. The lender collects payment from your client, takes their fee, and gives you the remainder. Perfect for B2B businesses with long payment terms.</p>

          <h3 id="merchant-cash-advances">Merchant Cash Advances</h3>

          <p>You receive a lump sum and repay through a percentage of your card transactions. No fixed monthly payment, which helps during slow months. The trade-off? It's one of the most expensive forms of borrowing.</p>

          <h3 id="government-schemes">Government-Backed Schemes</h3>

          <p>The Recovery Loan Scheme and Start Up Loans programme remain active in 2026. Government backing means lenders take on less risk, so approval rates are higher and rates are lower. Start Up Loans offer up to £25,000 with a fixed 6% interest rate and free mentoring.</p>

          <div class="callout callout-tip">
            <p class="callout-title">PRO TIP</p>
            <p>Start Up Loans offer up to £25,000 at just 6% fixed interest, plus free business mentoring. They're one of the most accessible options for new businesses in the UK.</p>

          <h2 id="documents-you-need">Documents You Actually Need</h2>

          <p>Stop gathering random paperwork. Here's what matters:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Business bank statements</strong> (last 6-12 months minimum)</li>
            <li><strong>Filed accounts or tax returns</strong> (last 2 years if available)</li>
            <li><strong>Management accounts</strong> (if your filed accounts are over 6 months old)</li>
            <li><strong>Cash flow forecast</strong> (next 12 months)</li>
            <li><strong>Business plan</strong> (if under 2 years old or for startup loans)</li>
            <li><strong>ID and proof of address</strong> (standard KYC requirements)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Here's where it gets tricky. Many applicants submit bank statements showing a healthy balance but with irregular income patterns. Lenders flag this. They want consistent revenue, not a few large payments scattered between empty months.</p>

          <h2 id="improve-your-chances">How to Improve Your Chances Before Applying</h2>

          <p><strong>Check your credit report first.</strong> Get your Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion reports. Dispute any errors. If your score needs work, spend 3-6 months building it before applying.</p>

          <p><strong>Reduce existing debt.</strong> Your debt-to-income ratio matters. Paying down credit cards or closing unused credit facilities can improve your profile significantly.</p>

          <p><strong>Prepare a cash flow forecast that's realistic.</strong> Lenders see thousands of forecasts. The ones that project 200% growth with no justification go straight in the bin. Conservative, well-reasoned projections build trust.</p>

          <p><strong>Start with your existing bank.</strong> They already know your cash flow patterns. Some banks offer preferential rates to existing business account holders.</p>

          <p><strong>Consider a broker.</strong> Business finance brokers have relationships with dozens of lenders and know which ones approve which profiles. Good brokers don't charge upfront fees. They take commission from the lender.</p>

          <div class="callout callout-warning">
            <p class="callout-title">WARNING</p>
            <p>Each loan application creates a hard search on your credit file. Multiple searches in a short period signal desperation to lenders. Get your application right before you submit.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="hidden-costs">Hidden Costs to Watch For</h2>

          <p>The interest rate isn't the only cost. Check for:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Arrangement fees</strong> (typically 1-3% of the loan amount)</li>
            <li><strong>Early repayment charges</strong> (some lenders penalise you for paying back early)</li>
            <li><strong>Late payment fees</strong> (can escalate quickly)</li>
            <li><strong>Personal guarantee costs</strong> (your house or assets are at risk)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Always calculate the total cost of borrowing, not just the monthly repayment.</p>

          <h2 id="what-if-rejected">What to Do If You Get Rejected</h2>

          <p>A rejection isn't the end. But applying to ten more lenders immediately is the wrong move.</p>

          <p>Instead, ask the lender why you were rejected. They're required to give you a reason. Fix whatever the issue is. Then try an alternative lender that's better suited to your profile.</p>

          <p>Alternative lenders like Funding Circle, iwoca, and Fleximize have different criteria than high-street banks. They're often more flexible with trading history and credit scores, though their rates reflect that flexibility.</p>

          <h2 id="when-loan-isnt-right">When a Business Loan Isn't the Right Answer</h2>

          <p>Sometimes borrowing isn't the solution. If your business is losing money consistently, a loan won't fix a broken model. It just adds debt to the problem.</p>

          <p>Consider alternatives: invoice finance if cash flow timing is the issue, equity investment if you need significant capital without repayment pressure, or grants if you're in an eligible sector or region.</p>

          <p>The best business loan is one you can comfortably repay while still growing. If the numbers don't work on paper, they won't work in practice either.</p>

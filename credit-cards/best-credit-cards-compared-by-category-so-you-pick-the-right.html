          <p>Not every credit card suits every person. A cashback card is pointless if you pay your balance by direct debit each month using a debit card. A balance transfer card is wasted if you don't carry existing debt.</p>
          
          <p>The "best" credit card depends entirely on what you need it to do. Here's how to match the right card type to your situation.</p>
          
          <h2 id="how-to-choose-the-right-credit-card">How to Choose the Right Credit Card</h2>
          
          <p>Before comparing individual products, answer one question: what problem are you solving?</p>
          
          <p><strong>Paying off existing debt?</strong> You need a balance transfer card with the longest 0% period you can get.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Earning rewards on spending you'll do anyway?</strong> You need a cashback or rewards card with benefits that match your spending patterns.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Travelling internationally?</strong> You need a card with no foreign transaction fees and ideally some travel insurance.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Building or rebuilding credit?</strong> You need a credit builder card designed for people with limited or damaged credit histories.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Managing big purchases?</strong> You need a 0% purchase card that gives you months to spread the cost interest-free.</p>
          
          <h2 id="best-for-everyday-spending-cashback-cards">Best for Everyday Spending: Cashback Cards</h2>
          
          <p>Cashback cards return a percentage of your spending directly to you. The rates are modest. Nobody's getting rich from credit card cashback. But if you use a card for regular spending and pay the balance in full each month, you're essentially getting a small discount on everything.</p>
          
          <p>Typical cashback rates range from 0.25% to 1% on standard spending, with some cards offering higher rates (3-5%) on specific categories like groceries or fuel for introductory periods.</p>
          
          <p><strong>What to watch:</strong> Some cashback cards charge annual fees of £20-30. Calculate whether your spending generates enough cashback to cover the fee and still deliver genuine value.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Who benefits most:</strong> People who already use a card for most purchases and pay in full monthly. The cashback is free money on spending you'd do regardless.</p>
          
          <h2 id="best-for-debt-reduction-balance-transfer-cards">Best for Debt Reduction: Balance Transfer Cards</h2>
          
          <p>If you're carrying credit card debt at a high interest rate, a balance transfer card can save you hundreds or thousands in interest by moving the balance to a new card with 0% interest for a set period.</p>
          
          <p>The best balance transfer offers in 2026 provide 0% interest for 20-29 months. This gives you nearly two and a half years to pay down debt without interest accumulating.</p>
          
          <p><strong>The transfer fee:</strong> Most cards charge 1.5-3.5% of the transferred amount as a one-off fee. On a £5,000 transfer, that's £75-175. Still dramatically cheaper than 12+ months of interest at 20%+ APR.</p>
          
          <p><strong>The trap to avoid:</strong> Minimum payments only. If you transfer £5,000 and make only minimum payments, you won't clear the balance before the 0% period ends. Divide your balance by the number of interest-free months and set up a standing order for that amount.</p>
          
          <h2 id="best-for-travellers-travel-credit-cards">Best for Travellers: Travel Credit Cards</h2>
          
          <p>Standard UK credit cards charge 2.99% on foreign transactions. Over a two-week holiday with £2,000 of spending, that's nearly £60 in hidden fees.</p>
          
          <p>Travel credit cards eliminate this charge entirely. The best ones also offer:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>No foreign ATM withdrawal fees</li>
          <li>Travel insurance (some with family cover)</li>
          <li>Airport lounge access (premium cards)</li>
          <li>Enhanced exchange rates</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p><strong>Worth knowing:</strong> Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act protects purchases between £100 and £30,000 made on a credit card. This applies internationally. If a hotel or airline goes bust after you've paid by credit card, you can claim the cost back from the card provider.</p>
          
          <h2 id="best-for-building-credit-credit-builder-cards">Best for Building Credit: Credit Builder Cards</h2>
          
          <p>If your credit score is low or you have no credit history (common for young adults, recent immigrants, or anyone who's avoided credit), a credit builder card helps establish a positive payment record.</p>
          
          <p>These cards come with low credit limits (usually £200-1,200) and high interest rates (30-40% APR). The interest rate doesn't matter because you should never carry a balance on these cards.</p>
          
          <p><strong>The strategy:</strong> Use the card for one small regular purchase (a streaming subscription, for example). Pay the balance in full every month by direct debit. After 6-12 months of perfect payments, your credit score improves, unlocking better card products.</p>
          
          <p><strong>What nobody mentions:</strong> Credit builder cards are deliberately designed to be unattractive for borrowing. The high APR discourages carrying a balance. The low limit prevents significant debt. Used correctly, they're a stepping stone, not a permanent solution.</p>
          
          <h2 id="best-for-big-purchases-0-purchase-cards">Best for Big Purchases: 0% Purchase Cards</h2>
          
          <p>Need to buy something expensive but don't want to pay interest on spreading the cost? Purchase cards offer 0% interest on new spending for an introductory period, typically 6-24 months.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Ideal for:</strong> Planned purchases like furniture, appliances, home improvements, or electronics where you know you can repay within the 0% window.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Not ideal for:</strong> Day-to-day spending where the convenience of "buy now, pay later" leads to accumulating unplanned debt.</p>
          
          <h2 id="what-happens-after-the-0-period">What Happens After the 0% Period</h2>
          
          <p>This is the information card providers really don't want you to focus on. Every 0% deal ends. When it does, the standard interest rate kicks in, typically 20-25% APR.</p>
          
          <p>If you haven't cleared your balance by that point, you're paying premium interest on whatever remains. The brilliant deal that saved you £500 in interest now costs you just as much in the following months.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Essential habit:</strong> Put a calendar reminder one month before your 0% period ends. Either clear the balance, transfer it to another 0% card, or prepare for the interest charges.</p>
          
          <h2 id="application-tips-that-actually-help">Application Tips That Actually Help</h2>
          
          <p><strong>Check eligibility before applying.</strong> Most card providers offer eligibility checkers that use a soft search (no impact on your credit score). Use these before formal applications.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Space out applications.</strong> Multiple credit card applications in a short period damage your credit score. Apply for one card at a time, wait for the result, then decide next steps.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Don't apply for the card with the best deal if you're unlikely to be accepted.</strong> The best balance transfer terms go to applicants with excellent credit. If your score is average, a slightly shorter 0% period with a higher acceptance probability is more useful than a rejection for a premium product.</p>

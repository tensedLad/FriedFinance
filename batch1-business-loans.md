**Title:** How to Get a Business Loan in the UK: What Actually Gets You Approved in 2026

**Meta Description:** Step-by-step guide to getting a business loan in the UK. Learn what lenders look for, which documents you need, and how to improve your chances of approval.

---

Getting a business loan sounds straightforward. You need money, a bank has money, you fill in a form. Done.

Except it rarely works that way.

Most UK business loan applications get rejected. Not because the business is bad, but because the application is. Lenders have specific criteria, and if you don't know what those are before you apply, you're wasting your time and potentially damaging your credit score with each failed attempt.

Here's how to actually get approved.

## What Lenders Look at Before Anything Else

Before diving into paperwork, understand this. Lenders care about one thing above all else: can you pay them back? Everything else, the documents, the business plan, the projections, exists to answer that single question.

They evaluate this through four lenses:

**Affordability.** Your revenue minus expenses needs to leave enough room for loan repayments. Most lenders want to see that repayments won't exceed 30-40% of your monthly profit.

**Credit history.** Both personal and business credit scores matter. If you're a sole trader, your personal score carries even more weight. A score above 700 with Experian puts you in a strong position. Below 550, and mainstream lenders will likely say no.

**Time in business.** Most traditional lenders want at least two years of trading history. Some alternative lenders will consider businesses with six months of revenue, but they charge higher rates for the added risk.

**Security.** Can you offer collateral? Property, equipment, outstanding invoices. Secured loans typically come with lower interest rates and higher approval odds.

## Types of Business Loans Available in the UK

Not all business loans work the same way. Picking the wrong type is one of the most common mistakes.

### Term Loans

The traditional option. You borrow a fixed amount, repay it over a set period with interest. Best for planned investments like equipment or expansion. Typical rates run from 3% to 15% APR depending on your profile.

### Revolving Credit Facilities

Think of this as a business overdraft on steroids. You get a credit limit and only pay interest on what you use. Great for managing cash flow gaps, but interest rates tend to sit higher than term loans.

### Invoice Finance

If you're waiting on invoices from clients, invoice finance lets you access up to 90% of that value immediately. The lender collects payment from your client, takes their fee, and gives you the remainder. Perfect for B2B businesses with long payment terms.

### Merchant Cash Advances

You receive a lump sum and repay through a percentage of your card transactions. No fixed monthly payment, which helps during slow months. The trade-off? It's one of the most expensive forms of borrowing.

### Government-Backed Schemes

The Recovery Loan Scheme and Start Up Loans programme remain active in 2026. Government backing means lenders take on less risk, so approval rates are higher and rates are lower. Start Up Loans offer up to £25,000 with a fixed 6% interest rate and free mentoring.

## Documents You Actually Need

Stop gathering random paperwork. Here's what matters:

- **Business bank statements** (last 6-12 months minimum)
- **Filed accounts or tax returns** (last 2 years if available)
- **Management accounts** (if your filed accounts are over 6 months old)
- **Cash flow forecast** (next 12 months)
- **Business plan** (if under 2 years old or for startup loans)
- **ID and proof of address** (standard KYC requirements)

Here's where it gets tricky. Many applicants submit bank statements showing a healthy balance but with irregular income patterns. Lenders flag this. They want consistent revenue, not a few large payments scattered between empty months.

## How to Improve Your Chances Before Applying

**Check your credit report first.** Get your Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion reports. Dispute any errors. If your score needs work, spend 3-6 months building it before applying.

**Reduce existing debt.** Your debt-to-income ratio matters. Paying down credit cards or closing unused credit facilities can improve your profile significantly.

**Prepare a cash flow forecast that's realistic.** Lenders see thousands of forecasts. The ones that project 200% growth with no justification go straight in the bin. Conservative, well-reasoned projections build trust.

**Start with your existing bank.** They already know your cash flow patterns. Some banks offer preferential rates to existing business account holders.

**Consider a broker.** Business finance brokers have relationships with dozens of lenders and know which ones approve which profiles. Good brokers don't charge upfront fees. They take commission from the lender.

## What to Do If You Get Rejected

A rejection isn't the end. But applying to ten more lenders immediately is the wrong move. Each application creates a hard search on your credit file, and multiple searches in a short period signal desperation to lenders.

Instead, ask the lender why you were rejected. They're required to give you a reason. Fix whatever the issue is. Then try an alternative lender that's better suited to your profile.

Alternative lenders like Funding Circle, iwoca, and Fleximize have different criteria than high-street banks. They're often more flexible with trading history and credit scores, though their rates reflect that flexibility.

## Hidden Costs to Watch For

The interest rate isn't the only cost. Check for:

- **Arrangement fees** (typically 1-3% of the loan amount)
- **Early repayment charges** (some lenders penalise you for paying back early)
- **Late payment fees** (can escalate quickly)
- **Personal guarantee costs** (your house or assets are at risk)

Always calculate the total cost of borrowing, not just the monthly repayment.

## When a Business Loan Isn't the Right Answer

Sometimes borrowing isn't the solution. If your business is losing money consistently, a loan won't fix a broken model. It just adds debt to the problem.

Consider alternatives: invoice finance if cash flow timing is the issue, equity investment if you need significant capital without repayment pressure, or grants if you're in an eligible sector or region.

The best business loan is one you can comfortably repay while still growing. If the numbers don't work on paper, they won't work in practice either.

### ARTICLE 2: CONTRARIAN

**Title:** Why Getting a Business Loan Might Be the Worst Financial Decision You Make This Year

**Meta Description:** Before applying for a business loan, read this. The hidden costs, psychological traps, and uncomfortable truths about UK business lending that nobody talks about.

---

Everyone tells you business loans are how you grow. Banks advertise them with smiling entrepreneurs standing in front of thriving shops. Business magazines rank them like they're awards.

Nobody talks about what actually happens after the money lands in your account.

## The Approval Trap

Here's the first thing nobody tells you. Getting approved for a business loan is designed to feel like an achievement. You applied, you proved yourself, you got the money. It triggers the same reward response as earning revenue.

But you haven't earned anything. You've taken on an obligation. And that obligation starts costing you money from day one, regardless of whether your business plan works.

The psychological trap is real. Studies from the Enterprise Research Centre show that businesses which take on debt in their first three years are 23% more likely to fail than those that bootstrap. Not because the debt caused failure directly, but because easy money masks problems that should have been solved first.

## The True Cost Is Never What They Quote

A lender quotes you 8% APR. Sounds reasonable, right? But let's actually calculate what you're paying.

Borrow £50,000 over 5 years at 8% APR. Your total repayment is roughly £60,830. That's £10,830 in interest.

Now add the arrangement fee. At 2%, that's another £1,000. If you need your accountant to prepare management accounts specifically for the application, add £500-800. Legal review of personal guarantee documentation? £300-500.

Your "8% loan" actually costs you £12,630-13,130. That's an effective rate closer to 10.5%.

And that's assuming everything goes perfectly. Miss one payment, and late fees compound. Breach a covenant, and the lender can demand full repayment immediately.

## Nobody Tells You About the Personal Guarantee Problem

This is the one that catches most business owners off guard.

Almost every UK business loan under £250,000 requires a personal guarantee. That means if your business can't repay, you're personally liable. Your house. Your savings. Your personal assets.

The whole point of running a limited company is limited liability. A personal guarantee erases that protection entirely for the amount borrowed.

Here's what makes it worse. Most personal guarantees survive even if you close the business, enter administration, or sell the company. The debt follows you personally until it's paid.

Yet lenders present personal guarantees as a routine formality. "Standard procedure," they say. As if pledging your family home as security should be treated casually.

## The Cash Flow Illusion

You borrow £30,000 because your business needs working capital. Suddenly your bank balance looks healthy. You feel liquid. You make decisions from a position of strength.

Except £30,000 minus your monthly repayment of £630 minus the costs you borrowed for leaves you with less breathing room than before. You've just spread the pain over 60 months instead of dealing with it now.

This sounds good on paper, but the reality is different. Businesses with loan repayments operate under constant pressure. Every quiet month becomes stressful because the repayment doesn't adjust to your revenue. January is slow? The lender doesn't care. Your direct debit goes out regardless.

Merchant cash advances solve this partially by linking repayments to revenue. But their effective APR often sits between 20% and 40%. You're paying a massive premium for flexibility.

## The Alternative Nobody Wants to Hear

What if you didn't borrow at all?

This is genuinely unpopular advice, especially in a financial content ecosystem built on connecting you with lenders. But hear me out.

Most businesses that seek loans for "growth" haven't maximised their existing resources. Before borrowing:

**Have you raised your prices?** Most service businesses are undercharging by 15-25%. A price increase costs nothing and delivers pure margin.

**Have you cut unnecessary costs?** Subscriptions, unused software, that premium office you don't really need. Many businesses carry £500-1,000 per month in costs that add zero value.

**Have you negotiated better payment terms?** Getting clients to pay in 14 days instead of 60 days can eliminate most cash flow problems without borrowing a pound.

**Have you considered pre-selling?** Take deposits. Offer annual plans at a discount. Use customer money to fund delivery rather than borrowing.

These aren't glamorous strategies. They don't come with the dopamine hit of seeing £50,000 land in your account. But they don't come with the 3am anxiety of wondering whether next month's repayment will clear either.

## When Borrowing Actually Makes Sense

I'm not saying business loans are always wrong. They work well in specific situations:

- You have a confirmed contract that requires upfront investment to fulfil
- You're buying revenue-generating equipment with a clear ROI timeline
- You're refinancing existing expensive debt at a lower rate

The common thread? Each scenario has a specific, measurable return that exceeds the cost of borrowing. "I want to grow" is not a business case. "I have a £100,000 contract that requires £30,000 in materials upfront" is.

## The Question You Should Ask First

Before applying for any business loan, answer this honestly: if the thing you're borrowing for doesn't work, can you still make the repayments?

If the answer is no, you're not investing. You're gambling. And the house, in this case literally your house, always has better odds.

**Title:** Start Up Business Loans UK 2026: Every Option Explained (Including the Ones Banks Don't Advertise)

**Meta Description:** Complete guide to startup business loans in the UK for 2026. Government-backed schemes, alternative lenders, and what you actually need to qualify.

---

Starting a business without savings is possible. Just not easy. And the lending landscape for startups looks nothing like what established businesses face.

Traditional banks rarely lend to businesses with no trading history. That's not pessimism, it's their risk model. Without revenue data, they can't assess your ability to repay. So they default to "no."

But that doesn't mean you're out of options. The UK has more startup funding routes than most founders realise. Some don't even require a credit check.

## The Government Start Up Loans Scheme

This is the single best option for most new businesses in the UK and it's surprisingly underused.

Run by the British Business Bank, the Start Up Loans scheme offers personal loans of £500 to £25,000 for business purposes. The key details:

- **Fixed interest rate:** 6% per year
- **Repayment period:** 1-5 years
- **No early repayment fees**
- **Free mentoring and business plan support**
- **Available to businesses under 3 years old**

The 6% rate is genuinely competitive. Many established businesses pay more through mainstream lenders. And the mentoring element is often more valuable than the money itself.

Here's where it gets interesting. These are technically personal loans used for business purposes. That means your personal credit history matters, but you don't need existing business revenue. A strong business plan and reasonable credit history can be enough.

You can apply as a sole trader, partnership, or limited company. Multiple founders can each apply for up to £25,000, meaning co-founded businesses could access up to £75,000 total.

## Alternative Lenders for Startups

If the government scheme doesn't fit, several alternative lenders work specifically with new businesses.

**Virgin StartUp** acts as a delivery partner for the government scheme but also offers its own mentoring programmes. Worth exploring if you want structured support alongside funding.

**Funding Circle** traditionally serves established businesses but has expanded into younger companies. You'll typically need at least 6 months of trading history and £50,000+ annual revenue.

**iwoca** offers flexible credit from £1,000 to £500,000 with decisions in hours. They'll consider businesses with limited trading history but charge higher rates to compensate, typically 2-6% per month.

**Startup Direct** provides small loans aimed specifically at pre-revenue businesses. Amounts are modest (£500-£10,000) but the approval criteria are more lenient.

## What About Bank Loans for Startups?

The honest answer: most high-street banks won't lend to a business with no trading history through their standard business loan products.

However, some offer startup-specific packages:

**NatWest** offers a free business account plus overdraft facilities for new businesses. Not a loan per se, but useful working capital.

**Barclays** has a startup programme with business planning tools and potential introductions to community lending schemes.

**HSBC** provides startup accounts with linked overdraft options.

The key insight is that banks want to build relationships with businesses that might become profitable clients. They might not lend you £50,000 on day one, but a business account, a small overdraft, and a strong trading record over 12-18 months positions you well for future lending.

## Grants: Free Money That Actually Exists

Before borrowing, check whether you qualify for grant funding. Unlike loans, grants don't need to be repaid.

**Innovate UK** offers grants for technology and innovation-focused businesses. Competition is fierce but awards range from £25,000 to several million.

**Local Enterprise Partnerships** provide regional grants aimed at job creation and economic development. Each LEP has different criteria and amounts.

**The Prince's Trust** offers grants and start-up loans for entrepreneurs aged 18-30 who are unemployed or working fewer than 16 hours per week.

**Sector-specific grants** exist for agriculture, renewable energy, creative industries, and social enterprises. Government grant databases list hundreds of opportunities.

## Building a Funding Stack

Smart founders rarely rely on a single source. A typical startup funding stack might look like:

1. **Personal savings:** £5,000 (demonstrates commitment)
2. **Start Up Loan:** £15,000 (covers core costs)
3. **Grant:** £5,000 (if eligible, reduces total borrowing)
4. **Overdraft facility:** £2,000 (emergency buffer)

Total: £27,000 from four sources, diversifying risk and keeping any single obligation manageable.

## What You Need to Qualify

The requirements vary by lender, but most startup loans need:

- **Business plan** with financial projections (12 months minimum)
- **Personal credit check** (affects rate and approval)
- **Proof of identity** and right to work in the UK
- **Description of what the funds will be used for**

Pro tip: lenders for startups care less about your projections being exactly right and more about whether they're logical. Show that you've thought about realistic scenarios, including what happens if revenue is 50% below forecast.

## Common Mistakes That Kill Startup Loan Applications

**Borrowing more than you need.** Start lean. You can always borrow more later with trading history behind you.

**Ignoring your personal credit score.** Check it before applying. Dispute errors. Pay down personal debt. Your personal finances directly affect your startup's borrowing power.

**Zero personal investment.** Lenders want skin in the game. Putting nothing of your own money in signals you're not committed enough to take the risk yourself.

**Vague use of funds.** "Marketing and growth" is not a plan. "£3,000 for website development, £2,000 for initial inventory, £1,500 for first quarter's market stall fees" shows you've done the work.

### ARTICLE 2: CONTRARIAN

**Title:** Most Startup Loans Set New Businesses Up to Fail. Here's Why.

**Meta Description:** The startup loan industry has a dirty secret: most funded startups still fail, often because of the loan itself. The uncomfortable truths founders need to hear.

---

There's a statistic the startup loan industry loves to hide. Over 60% of UK businesses that take on debt in their first year don't survive past year three. Yet the lending industry keeps pushing startup loans as though they're the rational first step for every aspiring entrepreneur.

They're not. And the reasons go deeper than most founders realise.

## The Debt-Before-Revenue Problem

Here's the fundamental issue nobody talks about. A startup loan puts you in debt before you have a single customer. You're making repayments based on projected revenue, which is a polite way of saying "money you hope exists."

Traditional businesses used to launch with savings, pre-orders, or a small client base. The modern advice? Borrow money, build the thing, then find customers.

This advice comes primarily from people who make money when you borrow. Think about who benefits from encouraging you to take on debt before proving your concept works.

A £15,000 Start Up Loan at 6% over 5 years means £290 per month in repayments. That's £290 every single month whether you've made a sale or not. For many early-stage businesses, that's the difference between surviving a slow quarter and closing down.

## The Business Plan Fiction

Startup loans require a business plan. Sounds sensible. But here's the uncomfortable truth about startup business plans: they're almost always wrong.

Research from Harvard Business School found that business plan projections are accurate less than 12% of the time. Yet lenders approve or reject based on these projections.

The result? Founders learn to write business plans that lenders want to see, not plans that reflect reality. They inflate revenue projections because conservative numbers get rejected. They minimise costs because realistic cost estimates make the loan look unaffordable.

You end up with a document designed to secure money rather than guide a business. And when reality doesn't match the fiction, you still owe the money.

## Nobody Tells You About the Mentoring Obligation

Government Start Up Loans come with "free mentoring." This is positioned as a benefit. And sometimes it genuinely is.

But here's what they don't emphasise. The mentoring is often mandatory, not optional. You're expected to attend sessions, provide updates, and follow action plans. For some founders, this structure is helpful. For others, it's time spent satisfying a programme requirement instead of building the business.

The mentors themselves are a mixed bag. Some are brilliant, experienced entrepreneurs with relevant expertise. Others are generalists who've completed a mentoring training programme but lack sector-specific knowledge.

You won't know which you're getting until you're committed.

## The Real Cost of "Only 6%"

Six percent sounds almost charitable compared to commercial lending rates. But let's put it in context.

If you take £25,000 at 6% over 5 years, you'll repay approximately £29,000. That £4,000 in interest represents real profit your business needs to generate above and beyond all other costs.

More importantly, that £290 monthly repayment is inflexible. Unlike equity investors who share the downside when things go wrong, lenders get paid regardless. Miss a payment and your personal credit score takes a hit, making future borrowing harder precisely when you might need it most.

## The Alternative Path Nobody Promotes

What if you treated your first year differently?

Instead of borrowing to build, what if you sold before you built? What if you tested demand with zero capital at risk?

**Freelance first.** If you're starting a design agency, take freelance clients before hiring staff or renting an office. Revenue before debt.

**Pre-sell.** Create prototypes or samples and take orders before manufacturing. If nobody buys, you've saved yourself £15,000 in debt on a product without demand.

**Start smaller than you think you should.** Market stalls before retail shops. A landing page before a full website. One product before a range.

Every successful business looks inevitable in hindsight. But almost none of them started the way their founders originally planned. Borrowing locks you into that original plan. Starting lean gives you room to discover what actually works.

## When a Startup Loan Genuinely Makes Sense

There are legitimate scenarios:

- You have confirmed purchase orders that require inventory investment
- You need specific equipment to deliver services you've already been hired for
- You're buying into a proven franchise model with documented success rates

Notice the pattern? Each scenario involves known demand, not projected demand. The loan bridges a timing gap between spending and earning, rather than funding a bet on whether customers exist.

If you can't point to real customers or contracts, you don't need a loan. You need customers first.

### ARTICLE 1: STANDARD INFORMATIONAL

**Title:** Small Business Loans UK: How to Compare, Apply, and Get Approved in 2026

**Meta Description:** Compare small business loans in the UK for 2026. Fixed rates from 3%, flexible terms, and approval even without perfect credit. See what's available now.

---

Small business loans are the most common form of external funding in the UK. Over 350,000 businesses apply for one every year. Yet the market is more fragmented than it's ever been.

High-street banks still dominate, but alternative lenders now account for nearly 40% of small business lending. Peer-to-peer platforms, fintech lenders, and invoice finance providers compete alongside Barclays and Lloyds. This is good news for borrowers, more choice usually means better deals, but it also means more confusion.

Here's how to cut through the noise.

## What Counts as a Small Business Loan?

In the UK lending market, small business loans typically refer to borrowing between £1,000 and £500,000 for businesses with annual turnover under £25 million. Beyond that threshold, you're in corporate lending territory with different products and processes.

Most small business loans fall into one of these structures:

**Fixed-rate term loans** give you certainty. You borrow a fixed amount, repay over an agreed period (usually 1-10 years), and your monthly payment never changes. Rates currently range from 3.5% to 15% APR depending on your risk profile and the lender.

**Variable-rate facilities** link to the Bank of England base rate plus a margin. Cheaper when rates are low, risky when they rise. With the base rate sitting at 4.5% in early 2026, variable loans aren't as attractive as they were five years ago.

**Asset finance** lets you borrow against specific assets like vehicles, machinery, or technology. The asset itself serves as security, which typically means lower rates than unsecured borrowing.

## Where to Get a Small Business Loan

### High-Street Banks

**Pros:** Lowest rates (from 3.5% APR), longer repayment terms, existing relationship advantages.
**Cons:** Slower decisions (2-6 weeks), stricter criteria, typically require 2+ years trading history.

Best for: established businesses with strong books and time to wait.

### Online/Alternative Lenders

**Pros:** Fast decisions (often same-day), more flexible criteria, will consider shorter trading history.
**Cons:** Higher rates (7-25% APR), shorter maximum terms, some charge monthly rather than annual interest.

Best for: businesses needing quick access, those with less-than-perfect credit, or younger companies.

### Peer-to-Peer Platforms

**Pros:** Competitive rates for strong profiles, transparent fee structures.
**Cons:** Not guaranteed to fully fund, investor appetite can fluctuate.

Best for: creditworthy businesses in sectors investors understand.

### Government-Backed Schemes

**Pros:** Reduced lender risk means higher approval rates, some offer fixed low rates.
**Cons:** More paperwork, specific eligibility requirements.

Best for: businesses that struggle with mainstream lending criteria.

## How to Compare Small Business Loans Properly

Comparing loans isn't as simple as looking at the interest rate. Here's what actually matters:

**Total cost of borrowing.** Calculate the full amount you'll repay over the loan term, including all fees. A loan at 7% with a 3% arrangement fee costs more than a clean 8% loan.

**Repayment flexibility.** Can you overpay without penalty? Is there an early repayment charge? Some lenders charge up to 5% of the outstanding balance if you pay early, making it expensive to clear debt when business is good.

**Personal guarantee requirements.** Understand exactly what you're signing. Some guarantees cover 100% of the loan balance. Others are limited to a percentage. This makes a material difference to your personal risk exposure.

**Speed of funding.** If you need money in 48 hours, a bank's 3-week process is irrelevant regardless of how good the rate is.

**Covenants and conditions.** Some loans come with financial covenants. Minimum revenue thresholds, profitability requirements, or restrictions on additional borrowing. Breaching these can trigger default clauses even if you're current on repayments.

## The Application Process Step by Step

**1. Prepare your financials.** At minimum: 12 months of bank statements, most recent filed accounts, and management accounts if your filed accounts are older than 6 months.

**2. Check your credit.** Both personal (Experian, Equifax, TransUnion) and business (Creditsafe, Dun & Bradstreet). Fix errors before applying.

**3. Define exactly what you need.** Amount, purpose, and timeline. "About fifty thousand for various things" won't cut it.

**4. Approach 2-3 lenders.** Use soft-search tools where available to avoid multiple hard credit checks. Many brokers offer this.

**5. Compare offers in writing.** Get formal quotes with all fees itemised. Verbal quotes mean nothing.

**6. Read the full agreement.** Especially the default clauses, personal guarantee terms, and what constitutes a "material adverse change" clause.

## Improving Your Approval Odds

**Reduce outstanding debt first.** Your debt-to-income ratio directly affects affordability calculations. Paying off a £10,000 credit balance could unlock a £50,000 business loan.

**Show consistent revenue.** Lenders love predictability. If your income swings wildly month to month, explain why in your application. Seasonal businesses should highlight annual patterns.

**Offer security if possible.** Secured loans have significantly higher approval rates and lower interest rates. Even partial security helps.

**Use a specialist broker.** Brokers know which lenders approve which profiles. A good broker saves you time and protects your credit file by targeting the right lender first time.

### ARTICLE 2: CONTRARIAN

**Title:** Small Business Loans Are Priced to Make Lenders Rich, Not to Help You Grow

**Meta Description:** The small business lending market has a pricing problem nobody discusses. How lenders extract maximum value and what you can do about it.

---

The UK small business lending market is worth over £60 billion annually. Banks and alternative lenders compete fiercely for your application. They spend millions on marketing to appear friendly, accessible, and on your side.

They're not on your side. They're on their shareholders' side. And the way small business loans are structured in the UK reflects that priority perfectly.

## The Rate You See Is Never the Rate You Pay

This is the first thing nobody tells you. Every advertised loan rate comes with a qualifying condition so specific that most applicants don't get it.

"Rates from 3.5% APR" means one customer, somewhere, with an impeccable credit history, significant security, and a long-standing relationship with the bank, got 3.5%. The actual average rate for UK small business loans in 2025 was 8.7% according to the Bank of England.

But even 8.7% understates the real cost. Add arrangement fees (1-3%), early repayment charges (1-5%), and the cost of providing security documentation, and most businesses pay an effective rate 2-3 percentage points higher than what's quoted.

Alternative lenders are worse. Much worse. Some quote monthly interest rates that look tiny. "Just 1.5% per month." That's 19.6% APR once you do the maths. Some merchant cash advance providers operate at effective rates above 40% APR. They avoid quoting APR entirely because the number would scare borrowers away.

## The Comparison Trap

Comparison websites, including the ones that look independent, make money when you click through and apply. They're not comparing loans for your benefit. They're ranking loans based on commission rates.

The loan at the top of the page isn't necessarily the best deal. It's the one that pays the comparison site the most when you apply. This is disclosed in fine print that nobody reads.

Even "editorial" recommendations involve commercial relationships. When a website "reviews" a business loan product, there's usually an affiliate link embedded. The review might be honest, but the selection of which products to review isn't random.

## Nobody Tells You About Covenant Risk

Loan covenants are financial conditions you must maintain throughout the loan term. Miss them, and the lender can call in the entire loan, even if you've never missed a payment.

Common covenants include minimum revenue thresholds (maintain at least 80% of the revenue shown at application), profitability requirements, and restrictions on taking additional debt.

Here's the problem. Business revenue isn't perfectly predictable. A single bad quarter can breach a revenue covenant, giving the lender the legal right to demand immediate full repayment at precisely the moment you can least afford it.

Most business owners don't discover covenants until they breach one. The documentation is deliberately dense, and lenders don't highlight these clauses during the sales process.

## The Personal Guarantee Scandal

I use the word "scandal" deliberately. The way personal guarantees are handled in UK business lending is the sector's biggest ethical failure.

A personal guarantee turns the director of a limited company into a personally liable individual. The entire point of incorporation, the legal separation between your business and personal finances, is overridden by a clause buried on page 37 of a lending agreement.

Yet personal guarantees remain standard for nearly all unsecured business loans under £250,000. They're presented as routine paperwork rather than what they actually are: a contract that puts your home at risk.

The Federation of Small Businesses has called for reform multiple times. Nothing has changed.

## What Smart Borrowers Do Differently

**Negotiate everything.** Arrangement fees, early repayment charges, and personal guarantee scope are all negotiable. Lenders rarely volunteer this information, but if you're a strong applicant with options, you have leverage.

**Get independent legal review.** Spending £500 on a solicitor to review a £50,000 loan agreement isn't a cost, it's insurance. They'll catch clauses you won't.

**Use the lender's competitor as leverage.** Get a formal offer from one lender and use it to negotiate with another. Competition works in your favour, but only if you create it.

**Consider whether you actually need a loan.** Revenue-based financing, invoice factoring, or even renegotiating supplier terms might solve your cash flow problem without the rigid obligation of a term loan.

The lending industry wants you to believe that borrowing is a normal, necessary part of business growth. Sometimes it is. But the structures are designed to benefit the lender first. Understanding that dynamic is the first step toward getting a deal that actually works for you.

**Title:** Types of Business Loans in the UK: 12 Options Explained Simply

**Meta Description:** Every type of UK business loan explained in plain English. Term loans, asset finance, invoice lending, MCAs, and more. Find which one fits your situation.

---

The phrase "business loan" covers at least a dozen different products, each designed for different situations, different business stages, and different risk appetites. Picking the right type matters more than getting the lowest rate.

A cheap loan that doesn't fit your cash flow pattern is worse than a slightly more expensive one that does.

## Fixed-Rate Term Loans

The most straightforward option. Borrow a set amount, repay in equal monthly instalments over an agreed period.

**How it works:** You receive the full loan amount upfront and repay principal plus interest monthly for 1-10 years. The rate is locked for the entire term.

**Best for:** Planned, one-off investments. Equipment purchases, refurbishment, expansion costs.

**Typical rates:** 3.5-12% APR depending on credit profile and security.

**Watch out for:** Early repayment charges. Many fixed-rate products penalise you for paying back early because the lender loses future interest income.

## Variable-Rate Term Loans

Same structure as fixed-rate but the interest tracks a reference rate, usually the Bank of England base rate plus a margin.

**How it works:** If the base rate drops, your payments decrease. If it rises, they increase.

**Best for:** Borrowers who believe rates will fall or who want flexibility without early repayment charges (many variable loans allow penalty-free overpayments).

**Typical rates:** Base rate + 3-8% margin.

**Watch out for:** Rate rises. With the base rate at 4.5% in 2026, a variable loan at base + 5% gives you 9.5% today, and potentially more tomorrow.

## Revolving Credit Facilities

Think credit card for your business, but with better rates and higher limits.

**How it works:** You have an approved credit limit. Draw funds when needed, repay when you can, only pay interest on what you've used. Once repaid, the credit is available again.

**Best for:** Managing irregular cash flow. Covering short-term gaps between paying suppliers and receiving client payments.

**Typical rates:** 5-15% APR on drawn amounts, plus a small facility fee (0.5-2%) on the total limit.

**Watch out for:** The temptation to treat available credit as revenue. Revolving facilities should fund timing mismatches, not ongoing losses.

## Invoice Finance

Turn unpaid invoices into immediate cash.

**How it works:** You send an invoice to a client with 30-60 day payment terms. An invoice finance provider advances 80-90% of the invoice value within 24 hours. When your client pays, the provider takes their fee and gives you the remainder.

Two variants exist: **invoice factoring** (the provider collects payment from your client) and **invoice discounting** (you collect payment yourself and settle with the provider).

**Best for:** B2B businesses with reliable clients who pay slowly.

**Typical costs:** 1-5% of invoice value per month.

**Watch out for:** Client perception. With factoring, your clients know you're using the service. Some view this negatively.

## Asset Finance

Borrow money specifically to purchase business assets.

**How it works:** The asset (vehicle, machinery, technology) serves as security for the loan. If you default, the lender takes the asset. This shared risk means lower interest rates than unsecured borrowing.

Three main structures: **hire purchase** (you own the asset at the end), **finance lease** (the lender owns it, you use it), and **operating lease** (short-term rental, return at the end).

**Best for:** Purchasing expensive equipment that generates revenue.

**Typical rates:** 4-10% APR for hire purchase, varying for leases.

**Watch out for:** Being locked into assets that depreciate faster than expected or become obsolete.

## Merchant Cash Advances

A lump sum repaid through a percentage of your card transactions.

**How it works:** You receive upfront capital. Repayment happens automatically as a fixed percentage (10-20%) of your daily card takings. Busy day? You repay more. Quiet day? You repay less.

**Best for:** Retail and hospitality businesses with high card transaction volumes and seasonal variation.

**Typical costs:** Factor rates of 1.1-1.5, meaning you repay £1.10-£1.50 for every £1 borrowed.

**Watch out for:** The total cost. A factor rate of 1.3 on £20,000 means you repay £26,000. The effective APR can exceed 40% because the repayment period is often short.

## Bridging Loans

Short-term, high-speed loans for property or time-sensitive transactions.

**How it works:** Borrow large sums (typically £50,000+) for 1-18 months. Usually secured against property. Interest is often "rolled up" and paid at the end rather than monthly.

**Best for:** Property purchases, auction buys, development projects where you need fast capital and have a clear exit strategy (refinance or sale).

**Typical rates:** 0.4-2% per month.

**Watch out for:** If your exit strategy fails, you're stuck with an extremely expensive loan.

## Government-Backed Loans

The UK government guarantees a portion of the loan, reducing lender risk.

**Recovery Loan Scheme:** Loans from £25,001 to £2 million with 70% government guarantee. Available through accredited lenders.

**Start Up Loans:** Up to £25,000 at fixed 6% for businesses under 3 years old.

**Best for:** Businesses that struggle to meet conventional lending criteria.

## Trade Finance

Funding specifically for importing goods.

**How it works:** A trade finance provider pays your overseas supplier directly. You repay once you've received and sold the goods.

**Best for:** Import businesses that need to pay suppliers upfront but don't receive revenue until goods are delivered and sold.

## Working Capital Loans

Short-term borrowing to cover day-to-day operational expenses.

**How it works:** Small loans (typically under £50,000) with short repayment periods (3-18 months). Quick approval, flexible use.

**Best for:** Covering payroll during slow periods, funding seasonal stock, or bridging payment delays.

## How to Choose the Right Type

Match the loan structure to the need:

| Need | Best Loan Type |
|------|---------------|
| One-off purchase | Term loan or asset finance |
| Irregular cash flow | Revolving credit |
| Slow-paying clients | Invoice finance |
| Retail capital needs | Merchant cash advance |
| Property transaction | Bridging loan |
| Day-to-day costs | Working capital loan |
| New business | Government Start Up Loan |

The cheapest loan isn't always the best loan. A term loan at 5% that forces you to make fixed payments during your quietest months is worse than a revolving facility at 8% that adjusts to your cash flow rhythm.

### ARTICLE 2: CONTRARIAN

**Title:** Why Choosing the "Right" Business Loan Type Still Won't Protect You

**Meta Description:** Every guide tells you to match loan type to need. Nobody mentions the structural risks present in every type. The hidden traps in UK business lending.

---

The internet is full of neat tables matching loan types to business needs. Term loans for equipment. Invoice finance for cash flow. MCAs for seasonal businesses.

This sounds logical. It feels like good advice. It gives you confidence that you're making an informed choice.

It's also dangerously incomplete.

## Every Loan Type Has a Structural Trap

The guides always explain how each product works. They rarely explain how each product fails. And every single business loan type has a failure mode that can seriously damage your business.

**Term loans fail when** your revenue drops but your fixed repayments don't. Two bad months and you're drawing on working capital to service debt, creating a spiral.

**Revolving credit fails when** it becomes normalised. Businesses start treating their credit facility as part of their cash flow rather than an emergency buffer. When the lender reviews the facility and reduces or withdraws it, you're suddenly short of money you'd been counting on.

**Invoice finance fails when** your client doesn't pay. The finance provider advanced you 85% of a £50,000 invoice. If the client goes bust, some providers have recourse agreements that mean you owe that £42,500 back.

**Merchant cash advances fail when** card volumes drop. The repayment as a percentage of sales sounds flexible, but if your revenue halves, the provider still needs a return. Some contracts include minimum repayment clauses that override the percentage mechanism during slow periods.

## The Diversification Myth

Financial advisors love suggesting you diversify your funding sources. Mix term loans with invoice finance and a credit facility. Spread the risk.

Here's the problem. Multiple lending products mean multiple personal guarantees, multiple covenant sets, and multiple relationships to manage. If one lender discovers you've breached a covenant with another, many agreements contain cross-default clauses that trigger their own default provisions.

You haven't diversified your risk. You've multiplied your points of failure.

## Nobody Tells You About Refinancing Risk

Most business lending guides assume you take a loan, repay it, and you're done. But many businesses need ongoing access to credit. This means refinancing when your current facility expires.

The trap: your renewal terms are based on your current position, not your original terms. If your business has had a rough year, your revolving credit facility might renew at a higher rate, lower limit, or with additional security requirements.

Worse, if the lender decides not to renew at all, you need to find alternative funding quickly and under pressure. This is precisely the worst time to be shopping for credit. Other lenders can see the non-renewal and wonder why.

## The Only Real Protection

Understanding loan types is necessary. But the real protection isn't choosing the right product. It's maintaining optionality.

Keep your credit file clean. Maintain relationships with multiple potential lenders. Build cash reserves when times are good. And never, ever become dependent on a single lending facility for your business's survival.

The best position with any lender is the ability to walk away. The moment you need the money more than they need your interest payments, the power dynamic shifts entirely in their favour.

### ARTICLE 1: STANDARD INFORMATIONAL

**Title:** Business Loans for Bad Credit UK 2026: Where to Apply and What to Expect

**Meta Description:** Can you get a business loan with bad credit in the UK? Yes. Here are the lenders who approve applications with low credit scores, and what it costs.

---

A bad credit score doesn't automatically disqualify you from business borrowing. It limits your options and increases your costs, but the door isn't closed.

Understanding where that door is, and what's waiting on the other side, saves you from rejection spirals that damage your credit further.

## What Counts as "Bad Credit" for Business Lending?

Credit scores aren't universal. Each agency uses a different scale:

- **Experian:** Below 561 is considered "poor"
- **Equifax:** Below 379 is "poor"
- **TransUnion:** Below 565 is "poor"

For business lending, most mainstream lenders also check your business credit score through services like Creditsafe or Dun & Bradstreet. A Creditsafe score below 40 out of 100 signals elevated risk.

Important nuance: "bad credit" isn't binary. A score of 520 on Experian gets treated very differently from a score of 350. Recent defaults within the last 12 months are treated far more seriously than missed payments from three years ago.

## Where to Actually Get Approved

### Alternative Online Lenders

These lenders built their business models around serving customers that banks reject.

**iwoca** offers credit from £1,000 to £500,000. They use their own credit scoring models that weigh recent trading performance heavily. A string of healthy bank statements can sometimes outweigh a poor credit score.

**Fleximize** provides loans from £5,000 to £500,000 for businesses trading over 6 months. They accept applications from businesses with adverse credit history but charge higher rates accordingly.

**Capify** specialises in merchant cash advances for businesses with card terminals. Your card transaction volume matters more than your credit score.

### Secured Lending

Offering security dramatically improves your chances. If you own property, equipment, or other valuable assets, secured loan providers will often overlook credit issues because they have a safety net if you default.

Asset-based lending, where the borrowed-for asset itself serves as security, is another route. Vehicle finance, equipment leasing, and technology finance all fall into this category.

### Peer-to-Peer Lending

Platforms like Funding Circle assess risk individually. While they do check credit, they also consider the overall strength of your business. Strong revenue, clear profitability, and a compelling growth story can sometimes compensate for historical credit issues.

### Government Start Up Loans

The government's Start Up Loan scheme conducts credit checks but isn't solely credit-score driven. They assess your business plan, your commitment, and your ability to repay. People with imperfect credit histories get approved regularly.

## What Bad Credit Costs You

Let's be direct. Bad credit means higher interest rates. How much higher depends on your situation:

| Credit Profile | Typical APR Range | Monthly Cost per £10,000 (3yr) |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| Excellent | 3.5-7% | £293-309 |
| Average | 7-15% | £309-347 |
| Poor | 15-30% | £347-416 |
| Very Poor | 30-50%+ | £416-499+ |

On a £10,000 loan over 3 years, the difference between excellent and poor credit is roughly £1,944 in extra interest. That's the real cost of bad credit, and it's worth investing time to improve your score before borrowing if you can.

## How to Improve Your Position Before Applying

**Check for errors.** Up to 20% of credit reports contain mistakes. Dispute anything incorrect with the relevant agency.

**Register on the electoral roll.** This sounds trivial but it's one of the easiest ways to boost your score.

**Reduce existing credit utilisation.** Using more than 50% of your available credit hurts your score. Pay down balances where possible.

**Add positive payment data.** Services like Experian Boost let you include rent payments and subscription payments in your credit file.

**Wait if you can.** Most negative marks lose their impact over time. A default from 4 years ago affects your score far less than one from 4 months ago.

## Red Flags to Avoid

**Guaranteed approval lenders.** No legitimate lender guarantees approval. This phrase typically signals either a scam or a lender charging predatory rates.

**Upfront fees.** Legitimate lenders deduct fees from the loan amount. Any lender asking you to pay money before you receive money is almost certainly fraudulent.

**No-credit-check loans.** Very few legal lenders can genuinely offer this. Most use this as a marketing hook and still conduct some form of check.

**Extremely fast approval.** Getting money within an hour rarely ends well. Speed usually correlates with cost. The fastest options tend to be the most expensive.

### ARTICLE 2: CONTRARIAN

**Title:** Bad Credit Business Loans Are Designed to Keep You in Bad Credit. Here's the Cycle.

**Meta Description:** The bad credit lending market profits from your desperation. How the interest rates, terms, and structures keep your credit score low and your costs high.

---

If you search "business loan bad credit" in Google, you'll find dozens of lenders eager to help. They use phrases like "we look at more than just your credit score" and "everyone deserves a second chance."

What they don't tell you is that their products are often structured in ways that make it extremely difficult to improve your credit situation. The bad credit lending market doesn't want to cure your problem. A cured customer is a lost customer.

## The Rate Trap

A business with bad credit gets offered a loan at 25% APR. Compared to the 3.5% a perfect-credit business pays, that's a 614% premium for having a lower score.

But here's the real kicker. Those high interest payments reduce your available cash flow. Less cash flow means more financial stress. More stress means higher chances of missed payments on other obligations. Which means your credit score stays low or gets worse.

The lender profits from your ongoing poor credit because it justifies ongoing high rates. There is zero financial incentive for them to help you improve.

## Nobody Tells You About the Prepayment Problem

Here's something genuinely infuriating. Some bad-credit lenders charge early repayment fees equivalent to the remaining interest.

Say you borrow £20,000 at 25% over 3 years. Your total interest cost is roughly £8,400. After 12 months of perfect payments, your credit has improved significantly. You find a lender offering 10%. You want to refinance.

But your original lender charges an early repayment fee of £4,200, the remaining interest you would have paid. Suddenly refinancing barely saves you anything. You're locked in at 25% because the exit cost eliminates the benefit of the cheaper loan.

This is by design. It's legal. And nobody mentions it until you try to leave.

## The Second Thing Nobody Tells You

Most bad-credit business lenders report to credit agencies, but not all of them report positive payment history. Some only report negatives.

Think about what this means. If you make every payment perfectly for 24 months, your credit score might not improve at all through this particular lender because they only report to the agencies when you miss payments.

Before signing anything, ask: "Do you report positive payment data to credit reference agencies?" If they don't, or they can't answer clearly, your on-time payments are building their profits without building your credit.

## The Third Thing Nobody Tells You

"Bad credit" lenders often have shorter maximum terms. Instead of a 5-year loan, you get 18 months or 2 years. Shorter terms mean higher monthly payments. Higher monthly payments reduce your cash flow margin further.

A £20,000 loan at 25% over 5 years costs £449/month. The same loan over 2 years costs £1,047/month. The shorter term nearly triples your monthly obligation.

Short terms benefit the lender. They get their money back faster, reducing their risk exposure. But they transfer that compressed repayment burden entirely to you.

## What You Should Actually Do

**Step one: Stop applying.** Every rejected application harms your score. If you've been rejected twice, stop and fix your profile first.

**Step two: Get your free credit reports.** All three agencies. Dispute errors. Add positive data. Register on the electoral roll.

**Step three: Wait actively.** While your score improves, investigate non-borrowing alternatives. Invoice factoring, customer deposits, supplier negotiations, government grants.

**Step four: When you do borrow, choose deliberately.** Confirm positive payment reporting. Confirm no early repayment charges. Confirm the total cost including all fees.

The bad credit lending market is built on urgency. "You need money now." "We can help today." Every piece of their marketing pushes you to act before thinking.

The most powerful thing a bad-credit borrower can do is slow down. Time improves credit scores. Patience unlocks better rates. And better rates break the cycle that keeps you trapped.

### ARTICLE 1: STANDARD INFORMATIONAL

**Title:** Getting a Loan to Buy a Business in the UK: Process, Options, and What Lenders Want to See

**Meta Description:** Planning to buy an existing business? Here's how to finance the purchase, what lenders require, and how to structure the deal so it gets approved.

---

Buying an existing business is fundamentally different from starting one. You're purchasing proven revenue, an established customer base, and operational systems. In theory, this makes lending decisions easier because there's performance data to assess.

In practice, loan applications for business acquisitions are more complex than standard business lending. Here's how to navigate them.

## Why Banks View Acquisition Loans Differently

When you borrow to buy a business, the lender is evaluating two things simultaneously: the quality of the business you're buying and your ability to run it profitably.

A business might have excellent financials, but if you have no experience in that sector, lenders worry. They're not just lending against current performance. They're betting that performance continues under new ownership.

This dual assessment means more scrutiny, more documentation, and longer processing times than a typical business loan.

## How Acquisition Loans Are Structured

Most business acquisition loans use one or more of these structures:

**Term loan for acquisition.** A standard fixed-rate loan covering part of the purchase price. Lenders typically finance 50-70% of the business value, requiring you to fund the rest through personal investment or other sources.

**Vendor finance.** The seller agrees to receive part of the payment over time. Common structures include 60% upfront and 40% over 2-3 years. This signals seller confidence in the business's future and reduces your borrowing requirement.

**Asset-based lending.** If the business has significant tangible assets (property, equipment, vehicles), these can secure a loan specifically tied to their value.

**Management buyout (MBO) funding.** Specialist funding for management teams buying the business they work in. Lenders view MBOs favourably because the team already knows the business.

**Earn-out arrangements.** The seller receives additional payments tied to the business hitting performance targets post-sale. Reduces upfront cost and aligns the seller's interests with continued success.

## What You Need to Prepare

**Business valuation.** Lenders want a third-party valuation, not the asking price. Common methods include multiple of earnings (typically 3-5x annual profit), asset valuation, or discounted cash flow analysis.

**Three years of the target business's accounts.** Filed accounts, management accounts, and tax returns. Lenders want to see stable or growing performance.

**Your personal financial statement.** Assets, liabilities, income, and personal credit history. Your net worth matters because most acquisition loans require personal guarantees.

**Post-acquisition business plan.** How will you run the business? What changes will you make? What does year-one cash flow look like including loan repayments?

**Due diligence report.** Key contracts, customer concentration, staff situation, pending litigation, regulatory compliance. Any surprises that emerge after purchase can derail the business and the loan.

Here's where it gets tricky. Due diligence costs money before you've even confirmed the purchase. Legal fees, accountancy review, and valuation costs can easily run £5,000-15,000. Budget for this upfront.

## Calculating Whether the Numbers Work

The fundamental test: can the business generate enough profit to cover loan repayments AND provide you with a liveable income?

**Example:** You're buying a business for £200,000. The lender finances £140,000 (70%). At 7% over 7 years, monthly repayments are approximately £2,112. The business generates £80,000 annual profit before owner's salary.

Monthly profit: £6,667
Monthly loan repayment: £2,112
Remaining for salary and growth: £4,555

That works. But reduce the profit by 25% (which happens during ownership transitions) and you're at £5,000 monthly profit, leaving £2,888. Still viable but tighter.

Run the numbers at 25% below current performance. If the deal still works at that level, you have adequate margin.

## Common Reasons Acquisition Loans Get Rejected

**Customer concentration.** If one client represents more than 30% of revenue, lenders see that as a single point of failure.

**Seller involvement.** If the business's success depends heavily on the current owner's personal relationships or skills, lenders worry about post-sale performance.

**Overpayment.** Paying significantly above market value reduces the lender's security. If you default and they need to sell the business to recover, an overpriced purchase means guaranteed losses.

**Insufficient equity.** Expecting 100% financing rarely works. You need meaningful personal investment to demonstrate commitment and share the risk.

### ARTICLE 2: CONTRARIAN

**Title:** Buying a Business With Borrowed Money Is the Most Overlooked Way to Destroy Your Finances

**Meta Description:** The acquisition loan model has a fundamental flaw that most buyers discover too late. The real risks of purchasing a business with debt.

---

Every business-for-sale listing reads like a fairytale. "Profitable established business with loyal customer base." "Turnkey opportunity." "Owner retiring, excellent growth potential."

Nobody mentions that up to 50% of business acquisitions fail to meet the buyer's financial expectations within the first three years. And when you've financed the purchase with a loan, "failing to meet expectations" doesn't just mean disappointment. It means debt you can't escape.

## The Valuation Fantasy

Businesses are valued on historical earnings. But you're buying the future, not the past.

The standard valuation method, a multiple of annual profit, assumes that historical performance predicts future results. But the moment ownership changes, the most important variable in the business changes too.

Regular customers who were loyal to the previous owner might leave. Staff who stayed because of their relationship with the old boss might move on. Suppliers who offered preferential terms as a personal favour might revert to standard pricing.

Nobody tells you this: the first 12 months after acquisition almost always see a revenue dip. Industry data suggests 15-30% is typical. If your loan repayments were calculated based on pre-acquisition revenue, you're suddenly underwater.

## The Due Diligence Illusion

You'll be told to conduct thorough due diligence. Hire a lawyer. Review the accounts. Check the contracts.

But due diligence has a fundamental limitation: it can only reveal what's documented. The most damaging issues in business acquisitions are the undocumented ones.

Verbal agreements with key customers that the seller "forgot" to mention. Staff who were told they'd receive pay rises that never made it into HR files. Regulatory compliance issues that haven't been flagged yet because no inspection has occurred.

The seller has every incentive to present the business in the best possible light. Not necessarily through active deception, but through selective disclosure. They highlight the positives and stay quiet about the uncertainties.

## Nobody Tells You About the Working Capital Trap

You buy a business for £200,000. You borrow £140,000. You invest £60,000 of your own money.

Then you discover the business needs £30,000 in working capital to operate, money for stock, deposits, payroll lag. This wasn't included in the purchase price because it's technically separate from the business value.

You now need either another loan or you need to inject more personal cash. Your total commitment has jumped from £60,000 to £90,000. Your return calculations just shifted significantly.

Smart acquirers negotiate working capital into the purchase agreement. Ensure the business is sold with agreed levels of cash and stock. But many first-time buyers don't know to ask for this, and sellers aren't volunteering the information.

## When Acquiring With Debt Works

It works when the business has contractual recurring revenue that genuinely transfers with ownership. When customers are locked into agreements, not casual relationships. When the economics work at 70% of current performance. And when you have enough personal reserves to survive 12 months of reduced profitability without the loan repayments becoming a crisis.

Outside those conditions, you're not investing. You're speculating with borrowed money. And the loan doesn't care about the difference.

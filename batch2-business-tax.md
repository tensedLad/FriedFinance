**Title:** UK Business Tax 2026: Every Tax You Need to Know, Rates, and Deadlines

**Meta Description:** Complete guide to UK business taxes in 2026. Corporation tax, income tax for sole traders, VAT, PAYE, and key deadlines every business owner needs.

---

Tax is the single largest expense most UK businesses face. Yet a surprising number of business owners don't fully understand which taxes apply to them, when they're due, or how much they should be setting aside.

The UK tax system treats businesses differently based on their structure. What you pay as a sole trader looks nothing like what a limited company pays. Getting this wrong doesn't just cost money in overpayment, it risks penalties for underpayment.

## Which Taxes Apply to Your Business?

Your tax obligations depend on your business structure:

### Sole Traders and Partnerships

You pay **income tax** on your business profits through Self Assessment. There's no separate "business tax." Your business income is treated as personal income and taxed accordingly.

**2025/26 income tax rates:**
- Personal allowance: £12,570 (tax-free)
- Basic rate: 20% on income from £12,571 to £50,270
- Higher rate: 40% on income from £50,271 to £125,140
- Additional rate: 45% on income above £125,140

You also pay **Class 2 and Class 4 National Insurance** on profits above certain thresholds (covered in detail below).

### Limited Companies

Your company pays **Corporation Tax** on profits. The rates changed in April 2023 and remain in effect:

- **Small profits rate:** 19% on profits up to £50,000
- **Main rate:** 25% on profits above £250,000
- **Marginal relief:** Gradual increase between £50,000 and £250,000

As a director, you'll also pay income tax on any salary or dividends you take from the company. The combination of corporation tax plus dividend tax is how the government ensures company profits are ultimately taxed at a rate comparable to employment income.

**2025/26 dividend tax rates:**
- £500 dividend allowance (tax-free)
- Basic rate: 8.75%
- Higher rate: 33.75%
- Additional rate: 39.35%

### VAT

If your taxable turnover exceeds £90,000 (the 2025/26 threshold), you must register for VAT and charge 20% on most goods and services. You can register voluntarily below this threshold if you want to reclaim VAT on business purchases.

**VAT schemes worth knowing about:**
- **Flat Rate Scheme:** Pay a fixed percentage of turnover (varies by sector, typically 9-14.5%). Simpler administration, sometimes cheaper.
- **Cash Accounting Scheme:** Only account for VAT when you actually receive or make payments, not when invoices are issued. Helps cash flow.
- **Annual Accounting Scheme:** Submit one VAT return per year instead of four. Make interim payments based on estimated liability.

### PAYE

If you employ staff (including yourself as a limited company director), you need to operate PAYE. This involves deducting income tax and employee National Insurance from wages and paying employer National Insurance on top.

**Employer NI rate:** 15% on earnings above £5,000 per employee (the secondary threshold, reduced from £9,100 in April 2025). The Employment Allowance lets eligible businesses deduct up to £10,500 from their NI bill.

## Key Tax Deadlines for 2026

Missing deadlines triggers automatic penalties. Here are the dates that matter:

| Deadline | What's Due |
|----------|-----------|
| 31 January 2026 | Self Assessment tax return AND payment for 2024/25 |
| 31 January 2026 | First payment on account for 2025/26 |
| 5 April 2026 | End of 2025/26 tax year |
| 31 July 2026 | Second payment on account for 2025/26 |
| 5 October 2026 | Deadline to register for Self Assessment if newly self-employed |
| 31 October 2026 | Paper Self Assessment return for 2025/26 |
| 31 January 2027 | Online Self Assessment return for 2025/26 |

**Corporation Tax deadlines** are different. Payment is due 9 months and 1 day after your accounting period ends. The CT600 return is due 12 months after.

**VAT returns** are quarterly, due 1 month and 7 days after the end of each VAT quarter.

## How Much to Set Aside for Tax

The number-one tax mistake: spending all your revenue and scrambling when the bill arrives.

As a rough guide:

**Sole traders** should set aside 25-35% of profit for income tax and National Insurance combined.

**Limited company directors** paying themselves through a salary-dividend split should set aside roughly 20% of company profits for corporation tax, plus whatever personal tax is due on dividends.

Open a separate savings account. Transfer your tax allocation weekly or monthly. Treat it as money that isn't yours because it isn't.

## Reducing Your Tax Bill Legally

**Claim all allowable expenses.** Many business owners miss legitimate deductions. Office costs, travel, professional subscriptions, insurance, accounting fees, even a proportion of household bills if you work from home.

**Use your pension.** Pension contributions are tax-deductible for both sole traders (through personal contributions) and limited companies (through employer contributions). This is one of the most effective tax reduction strategies available.

**Consider your structure.** At certain profit levels, operating as a limited company saves significant tax compared to sole trading. The crossover point is typically around £30,000-40,000 annual profit, but this depends on your specific circumstances.

**Maximise capital allowances.** The Annual Investment Allowance lets you deduct the full cost of qualifying capital expenditure (up to £1 million) from profits in the year of purchase.

**Claim R&D tax credits.** If your business develops new products, processes, or services, you may qualify for R&D tax relief. SMEs can claim up to 186% of qualifying expenditure as a deduction. This is significantly underused by smaller businesses.

### ARTICLE 2: CONTRARIAN

**Title:** UK Business Tax Is Designed to Punish Growth. Here's How the System Actually Works Against You.

**Meta Description:** The UK tax system claims to support business growth. The reality is a structure of thresholds, cliffs, and traps that penalise exactly the businesses trying to scale.

---

Politicians love talking about supporting UK businesses. "We're cutting red tape." "We're backing entrepreneurs." "Britain is open for business."

Then you look at the actual tax system and see something very different. A structure riddled with cliff edges, where earning one pound more can cost you hundreds. Where growing past certain thresholds triggers disproportionate additional burdens. Where the complexity itself is a tax on your time.

## The VAT Cliff Edge

Your business turns over £89,000. You're VAT-free. Life is simple.

You hit £90,001. Suddenly you must register for VAT, charge 20% on everything, file quarterly returns, and maintain VAT-compliant records.

Nobody tells you this: the real cost isn't the 20% you charge customers. It's the administrative burden. HMRC estimates that VAT compliance costs small businesses 4 hours per month. That's 48 hours per year, roughly £2,400 in time at a modest rate, spent on government paperwork.

And if your customers are consumers (not VAT-registered businesses), you can't pass the 20% on without raising prices. Effectively, you either absorb a 20% cost increase or lose customers to competitors who stay below the threshold.

This creates a perverse incentive. Businesses artificially suppress their growth to stay below £90,000. HMRC data shows a suspicious clustering of businesses with turnover between £80,000 and £89,000. Everyone knows what's happening. Nobody fixes it.

## The Corporation Tax Marginal Rate Scandal

When corporation tax changed in 2023, the headline was "19% for small businesses, 25% for large." What wasn't headlined was the marginal rate between £50,000 and £250,000 profit.

Due to how marginal relief works, businesses earning between these thresholds pay an effective marginal rate of 26.5% on each additional pound of profit. That's higher than the main rate of 25% that applies to the largest companies in the country.

Read that again. A business earning £100,000 profit faces a higher marginal tax rate than a business earning £10 million profit. The system literally punishes mid-sized businesses more heavily than large ones.

This isn't an accident. It's a mathematical consequence of tapering relief that was designed for political messaging ("19% for small businesses!") rather than economic sense.

## The Personal Allowance Trap

If you're a sole trader earning around £100,000, you hit another nasty cliff. Your personal allowance (£12,570) starts being withdrawn at a rate of £1 for every £2 earned above £100,000.

This creates an effective marginal tax rate of 60% on income between £100,000 and £125,140. Not 40%. Not 45%. Sixty percent.

For every additional £1,000 you earn in this band, you keep just £400. The government takes £600 through the combination of 40% income tax plus the lost personal allowance.

Nobody tells you this at the start of your career. You work harder, earn more, and then discover that the reward for crossing £100,000 is having more than half your additional income taken away.

## The National Insurance Double Tax

If you're a sole trader, you pay both Class 2 NI (flat rate) and Class 4 NI (9% on profits between £12,570 and £50,270, 2% above). This is on top of income tax, creating a combined marginal rate of 29% at basic rate or 42% at higher rate.

If you're a limited company employing yourself, the company pays 15% employer NI on your salary, then you pay employee NI, then income tax, then corporation tax on profits, then dividend tax when you extract more.

The total effective tax rate when you account for all layers can exceed 50% at relatively modest income levels. This is a system that claims to be competitive globally while taxing entrepreneurship more heavily than employment in many scenarios.

## What Smart Business Owners Actually Do

They don't fight the system. They structure around it.

**Stay below thresholds or jump well past them.** The worst place to be is just above a cliff edge. Either manage income to stay below, or grow enough that the threshold becomes proportionally insignificant.

**Maximise pension contributions.** Every £1,000 put into a pension saves £200-450 in tax. No other legal strategy offers comparable returns.

**Split income where possible.** Married couples can arrange shareholdings so dividends are split, keeping both people in lower tax bands.

**Invest in allowable capital expenditure.** The £1 million Annual Investment Allowance lets you reinvest profits into the business while reducing your tax bill.

The UK tax system doesn't reward growth linearly. It punishes it at specific points. Understanding where those points are, and planning around them, is worth more than any tax tip about claiming for your phone bill.

### ARTICLE 1: STANDARD INFORMATIONAL

**Title:** Making Tax Digital 2026: What's Changed, Who's Affected, and How to Comply

**Meta Description:** Making Tax Digital now applies to income tax. Here's what sole traders and landlords need to do, which software to use, and the key deadlines.

---

Making Tax Digital (MTD) is HMRC's programme to digitise the UK tax system. It started with VAT. Now it's expanding to income tax, and this is where it gets significant for millions of self-employed people.

If you're a sole trader or landlord with qualifying income above £50,000, MTD for Income Tax Self Assessment (ITSA) starts in April 2026. If your income is above £30,000, you're next in April 2027.

This isn't optional. It's a legal requirement.

## What MTD Actually Requires You to Do

MTD replaces annual Self Assessment returns with a digital recordkeeping and reporting system. Here's what changes:

**Digital records.** You must keep your income and expense records using MTD-compatible software. Spreadsheets are allowed only if they can connect digitally to HMRC systems.

**Quarterly updates.** Instead of one annual return, you submit quarterly summaries of income and expenses to HMRC through your software. These are due within one month of each quarter end.

**End of Period Statement (EOPS).** After the tax year ends, you submit a finalisation statement confirming your figures are complete and correct. This replaces the annual Self Assessment return.

**Final declaration.** You confirm your total taxable income across all sources and make any necessary adjustments.

The quarterly deadlines follow the tax year quarters:
- Q1: 6 April to 5 July (submission by 5 August)
- Q2: 6 July to 5 October (submission by 5 November)
- Q3: 6 October to 5 January (submission by 5 February)
- Q4: 6 January to 5 April (submission by 5 May)

## Who Needs to Comply and When

**April 2026:** Self-employed individuals and landlords with qualifying income above £50,000

**April 2027:** Self-employed individuals and landlords with qualifying income above £30,000

**Future (TBC):** Those with income below £30,000 and potentially partnerships. No confirmed date yet.

"Qualifying income" means gross income from self-employment or property, not profit. If your freelance revenue is £55,000 but after expenses your profit is £30,000, you're still in the April 2026 group because your gross income exceeds £50,000.

## Which Software to Use

HMRC maintains a list of MTD-compatible software. Major options include:

**FreeAgent** is popular with freelancers and micro-businesses. Includes banking integration, invoicing, and automatic categorisation. From £14.50/month, though many banks offer it free (NatWest, Mettle, Tide).

**Xero** offers comprehensive accounting with MTD compatibility. Strong for businesses with employees or complex needs. From £15/month.

**QuickBooks** provides Self-Employed and Small Business tiers, both MTD-compatible. From £10/month.

**Sage** offers various products for different business sizes. Well-established with accountants. Pricing varies.

**HMRC's own free software** exists for simple cases but has limited functionality. Fine if you have straightforward income and expenses with no complications.

When choosing, consider:
- Does it integrate with your bank account?
- Can your accountant access it directly?
- Does it handle your specific business type well?
- What happens if you outgrow it?

## How to Prepare Now

**Step 1: Check whether you're affected.** Review your qualifying income for the current tax year. If it's above £50,000, you need to be ready by April 2026.

**Step 2: Choose your software.** Don't wait until March. Migration takes time, especially if you're moving from paper records or basic spreadsheets.

**Step 3: Set up digital recordkeeping.** Start recording income and expenses in your chosen software now. Even before MTD requires it, digital records are easier to manage.

**Step 4: Talk to your accountant.** If you use one, discuss how MTD changes your working relationship. Some accountants want direct access to your software. Others prefer you to send exported data.

**Step 5: Understand the penalties.** Late submissions attract penalties under HMRC's new points-based system. Each late submission earns a point. Accumulate enough points and you receive a financial penalty. The intention is to target persistent late filers rather than occasional mistakes.

## What MTD Doesn't Change

Your tax liability doesn't change. MTD is about how you report, not how much you owe. Your allowable expenses, tax rates, and payment dates remain the same.

You can still use an accountant. MTD doesn't require you to do everything yourself. Your accountant can submit on your behalf using agent software.

Your payment dates are largely unchanged. You'll still pay tax in January and July through the payment on account system, though HMRC has discussed aligning payments more closely with quarterly reporting in the future.

### ARTICLE 2: CONTRARIAN

**Title:** Making Tax Digital Costs More Than HMRC Admits, and Small Businesses Are Paying the Price

**Meta Description:** HMRC says MTD saves businesses time. Independent research says the opposite. The real costs of Making Tax Digital that nobody quantifies honestly.

---

HMRC's promotional material for Making Tax Digital is fascinating reading. "Reduce errors." "Save time." "Better manage your finances." It reads like a software sales brochure.

Which makes sense, because the biggest beneficiaries of MTD aren't taxpayers. They're the software companies selling MTD-compatible products.

## The Cost HMRC Doesn't Count

HMRC's own impact assessment estimated that MTD for Income Tax would cost businesses an average of £320 per year in software and compliance time.

Independent research from the Federation of Small Businesses puts the figure at £500-1,000 per year for most micro-businesses. When accounting for the learning curve, initial setup time, and ongoing quarterly reporting obligations, the figure is even higher.

Nobody tells you this: the "save time" claim in HMRC's marketing is based on businesses that were already using digital tools. For the estimated 1.1 million sole traders who manage their records on paper or basic spreadsheets, MTD doesn't save time. It creates an entirely new administrative obligation that didn't exist before.

Quarterly reporting alone adds 4-8 hours of work per year compared to a single annual return. For someone earning £55,000 as a plumber or electrician, those hours are billable time that's now spent on HMRC compliance instead of paid work.

## The Software Lock-In Problem

Once you commit to an MTD-compatible software platform, switching costs are significant. Your data, your categorisation rules, your bank connections, your historical records, they're all locked into that platform.

Software companies know this. Which is why many offer attractive introductory pricing that increases substantially after 6-12 months. FreeAgent was free through NatWest but now requires a NatWest business account. QuickBooks offers 50% off for the first 6 months. After that, you're paying full price and the switching cost is too high to leave.

The UK government has effectively mandated that millions of self-employed people must buy software from commercial providers. This isn't framed as a private sector subsidy, but that's exactly what it is.

## The Second Thing Nobody Mentions

Quarterly reporting gives HMRC near real-time visibility of your income and expenses. The official reason is "better financial management."

The unofficial implication is that HMRC can now identify potential tax shortfalls during the year rather than after it. If your quarterly submissions suggest a growing tax liability, expect prompts to increase your payments on account.

This isn't necessarily bad tax policy. But it's worth understanding the true motivation. MTD isn't primarily about helping you manage your finances. It's about helping HMRC manage theirs.

## Who Actually Benefits

**Accountancy firms** benefit because MTD creates billable compliance work.

**Software companies** benefit because 4.2 million UK sole traders now need their products by law.

**HMRC** benefits from better data, faster compliance identification, and reduced processing costs.

**Businesses?** Some genuinely benefit, particularly those who were using inadequate systems. Digital records are objectively better than shoeboxes of receipts.

But for the majority of small self-employed people who were managing perfectly well with annual returns and simple spreadsheets, MTD is an unfunded mandate. It increases costs, increases administrative burden, and shifts HMRC's operational expenses onto the taxpayer.

## Making the Best of It

None of this changes the fact that MTD is mandatory. So if you're affected:

**Choose the cheapest adequate software.** Don't buy features you don't need. Basic MTD compliance doesn't require a £30/month platform.

**Check if your bank offers free software.** Several banks include FreeAgent or similar at no extra cost.

**Automate bank feeds.** The single biggest time-saver is connecting your software to your business bank account so transactions import automatically.

**Batch your quarterly work.** Set one hour on a specific date each quarter for review and submission. Don't spread MTD work across multiple sessions.

The system is what it is. But understanding who benefits, and it's not primarily you, helps you make more informed decisions about how much time and money to invest in compliance.

### ARTICLE 1: STANDARD INFORMATIONAL

**Title:** How to File Self Assessment Tax Returns in the UK: Complete 2026 Guide

**Meta Description:** Step-by-step instructions for filing your Self Assessment tax return in 2026. Registration, deadlines, what to include, and how to avoid penalties.

---

Filing a Self Assessment tax return is one of those tasks that feels more intimidating than it actually is. HMRC processes over 12 million returns every year. The vast majority are straightforward.

The complexity isn't in the filing itself. It's in gathering the right information, understanding what you can claim, and knowing the deadlines.

## Who Needs to File a Self Assessment Return?

Not everyone does. You need to file if you:

- Are self-employed (sole trader or partner) with income over £1,000
- Earn more than £150,000 from employment
- Have untaxed income (rental, investments, savings interest above the allowance)
- Are a company director (though some PAYE-only directors may be exempt)
- Have capital gains tax to pay
- Need to claim tax relief on pension contributions or charitable donations
- Are a higher-rate taxpayer claiming marriage allowance adjustment

If none of these apply and all your income is taxed through PAYE, you probably don't need to file.

## Step-by-Step: Filing Your 2025/26 Return

### Step 1: Register (If You Haven't Already)

New to Self Assessment? Register with HMRC as soon as possible. For the 2025/26 tax year, the registration deadline is 5 October 2026.

Register online through HMRC's website. You'll receive a Unique Taxpayer Reference (UTR) by post within 10 working days. You'll also need to set up a Government Gateway account if you don't have one.

If you're registering as self-employed, you'll automatically be registered for Class 2 National Insurance at the same time.

### Step 2: Gather Your Information

Before you start the return, collect:

**Income records:**
- Invoices issued and payments received from self-employment
- P60 or P45 from any employment
- Rental income records
- Bank interest statements
- Dividend vouchers
- Any other income sources

**Expense records:**
- Business expenses receipts and records
- Allowable rental property expenses
- Pension contribution statements
- Gift Aid donation records
- Student loan balance (if applicable)

**Other documents:**
- Previous year's tax return (for reference)
- National Insurance number
- UTR number
- Bank details for refunds (or to set up direct debit for payments)

### Step 3: Complete the Return

You can file online through HMRC's website or through compatible software. The online system walks you through each section with prompts and guidance.

**Key sections for self-employed individuals:**

**Turnover.** Your total business income for the year. Include all invoices raised, even if not yet paid. Cash basis accounting (reporting income when received and expenses when paid) is available for businesses with turnover under £150,000 and is simpler for most sole traders.

**Allowable expenses.** Everything you can legitimately claim. Office costs, travel, stock, marketing, professional fees, insurance, telephone, internet, and more. Keep records for at least 5 years.

**Capital allowances.** The cost of equipment, vehicles, and other assets used in your business. The Annual Investment Allowance covers most purchases.

**Working from home.** You can claim a proportion of household costs (heating, lighting, council tax, mortgage interest or rent) based on the percentage of your home used for business, and for how long. Alternatively, HMRC offers simplified expenses of £6/week (£312/year) without needing to calculate actual costs.

### Step 4: Calculate and Pay

Your return calculates your total tax liability including:
- Income tax on all income sources
- Class 2 NI (currently £3.45/week if profits exceed £12,570)
- Class 4 NI (9% on profits between £12,570 and £50,270, 2% above)
- Student loan repayments if applicable

**Payment dates:**
- 31 January following the tax year end (balancing payment plus first payment on account for next year)
- 31 July (second payment on account)

Payments on account are each 50% of the previous year's tax bill. If your income changes significantly, you can apply to reduce them.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Missing the deadline.** Even one day late triggers a £100 automatic penalty. After three months, daily penalties of £10 apply (up to £900). After six months, an additional 5% of tax due. After twelve months, another 5%.

**Forgetting to claim all expenses.** The most commonly missed deductions: professional subscriptions, working from home costs, mileage (45p per mile for first 10,000 miles), and training directly related to your current trade.

**Not keeping records.** You don't submit receipts with the return, but you must keep them for at least 5 years in case HMRC enquires.

**Confusing turnover with profit.** Your tax is calculated on profit (turnover minus expenses), not gross income. Failing to claim legitimate expenses means paying tax on money you've already spent.

**Ignoring payments on account.** These catch people off guard. If your tax bill is over £1,000 and less than 80% was collected through PAYE, you'll need to make advance payments toward next year's bill.

## When to Use an Accountant

An accountant is worth the cost if:
- Your affairs are complex (multiple income sources, property, investments)
- You're unsure what you can and can't claim
- You regularly approach the higher rate threshold and want to plan ahead
- Your time is more valuably spent on billable work

Typical cost: £150-400 for a straightforward Self Assessment return. More for complex situations.

### ARTICLE 2: CONTRARIAN

**Title:** Filing Your Own Tax Return Is Probably Costing You More Than an Accountant Would

**Meta Description:** Millions of UK self-employed people file their own taxes to save money. Most of them overpay because they don't claim what they're entitled to.

---

The DIY tax return is a point of pride for many freelancers. "I do my own taxes." It sounds independent. Financially savvy. Taking control.

Except for the majority of self-employed people who file their own returns, the money they "save" on accountancy fees is dwarfed by the deductions they miss.

## The Deduction Gap

HMRC's own data shows that self-filed returns claim, on average, 15-20% fewer expenses than accountant-prepared returns for comparable businesses. On a £50,000-turnover business, that could mean £3,000-5,000 in unclaimed deductions, resulting in £600-£1,500 in unnecessary tax paid.

An accountant costs £200-400. The maths doesn't require a calculator.

Nobody tells you this: HMRC doesn't design its Self Assessment forms to help you claim everything you're entitled to. The forms ask what you've spent. They don't prompt you to consider whether you've missed anything.

An accountant's job is precisely to ask those questions. Have you claimed for use of home? Capital allowances on that laptop? Mileage at 45p? Professional subscriptions? Training courses? Insurance? Bank charges?

Most DIY filers forget at least two of those categories.

## The Time Cost Nobody Calculates

The average Self Assessment return takes 7-10 hours to complete when you include gathering receipts, categorising expenses, reading HMRC guidance, and actually filling in the boxes. For complex returns with multiple income sources, allow 15-20 hours.

If your billable rate is £40/hour, a 10-hour return costs you £400 in lost earning time. Add the £1,000 in missed deductions, and your "free" tax return just cost your business £1,400.

An accountant charging £300 would have saved you time, claimed more deductions, and let you spend those 10 hours doing what your business actually gets paid for.

## Nobody Tells You About Error Risk

DIY returns have significantly higher error rates than professionally prepared ones. HMRC doesn't publish exact figures, but tax investigation statistics show that self-filed returns are opened for enquiry at roughly twice the rate of accountant-prepared ones.

Not because DIY filers are dishonest. Because they're more likely to make mistakes that trigger HMRC's risk algorithms. Unusual expense patterns, inconsistent figures year to year, or claiming things in the wrong category can all flag a return for review.

A tax investigation, even one that finds nothing wrong, is enormously stressful, time-consuming, and potentially expensive if you need professional representation. Investigation protection insurance costs £50-100/year and most accountancy packages include it.

## When DIY Genuinely Works

If your situation is truly simple, one income source, straightforward expenses, turnover under £30,000, then self-filing through HMRC's online system is perfectly reasonable. The forms are clear enough for uncomplicated returns.

But the moment you have property income, investments, income near the higher rate threshold, a spouse you could be splitting income with, or business assets with capital allowance implications, the DIY approach is almost certainly costing you more than professional help would.

The irony? The people most likely to file their own returns are the ones trying to save money. And the people most likely to benefit from professional help are the ones who don't realise how much they're overpaying.

### ARTICLE 1: STANDARD INFORMATIONAL

**Title:** National Insurance for the Self-Employed UK 2026: Rates, Thresholds, and What You Actually Pay

**Meta Description:** Self-employed National Insurance rates for 2026. Class 2 and Class 4 contributions explained, including thresholds, voluntary contributions, and how NI affects your pension.

---

National Insurance is the tax nobody thinks about until they see the bill. For employed people, it's deducted automatically. For the self-employed, you calculate and pay it yourself through Self Assessment.

The system is confusing because there are multiple "classes" of NI, each with different rates, thresholds, and purposes. Here's how it works for sole traders and partners.

## The Two Types of Self-Employed NI

### Class 2 National Insurance

Class 2 is a flat-rate contribution that counts toward your qualifying years for the State Pension and certain benefits.

**2025/26 rates:**
- £3.45 per week (£179.40/year) if profits exceed the Small Profits Threshold (£6,725)
- Voluntary payment available if profits are below the threshold

Class 2 is important because each year you pay it counts as a qualifying year for the State Pension. You need 35 qualifying years for the full new State Pension (currently £221.20/week). Gaps in your record can be filled by making voluntary Class 2 contributions, which is remarkably good value at under £180/year.

### Class 4 National Insurance

Class 4 is the main NI contribution for self-employed people. It's calculated as a percentage of your profits and collected through Self Assessment.

**2025/26 rates:**
- 6% on profits between £12,570 and £50,270
- 2% on profits above £50,270

**Example calculation:**
If you earn £45,000 profit:
- Class 4 NI: 6% × (£45,000 - £12,570) = 6% × £32,430 = £1,945.80
- Class 2 NI: £179.40
- Total NI: £2,125.20

Combined with income tax, your total tax bill on £45,000 profit would be approximately £8,611 (income tax £6,486 + NI £2,125).

## How Self-Employed NI Compares to Employment

Here's where it gets interesting. Employed people pay 8% NI on earnings between £12,570 and £50,270 (Class 1). Their employer pays an additional 15% on earnings above £5,000 (reduced threshold from April 2025).

Self-employed people pay 6% on the same band. That's 2 percentage points less than employees, and there's no employer contribution equivalent.

This gap exists because self-employed people don't get statutory sick pay, statutory maternity pay, or Jobseeker's Allowance. You pay less NI, but you get fewer benefits. Whether it's a good deal depends on your perspective.

## Protecting Your State Pension

Each tax year where you pay NI (or receive NI credits) counts as a qualifying year for the State Pension. Check your record through the government's "Check your State Pension" tool to see how many qualifying years you have and whether there are gaps.

If you have years with no contributions (perhaps because you earned below the threshold), you can make voluntary Class 2 contributions to fill them. At under £180/year, this is one of the best-value investments available. It buys you 1/35th of the full State Pension, which works out to roughly £6.32/week (£329/year) in pension income for life.

The deadline for filling gaps is generally 6 tax years back, but there are transitional protections for earlier years. Check soon because some deadlines are approaching.

## NI for Limited Company Directors

If you operate through a limited company and pay yourself a salary, you pay Class 1 NI (employee rate) and your company pays Class 1 NI (employer rate).

The most common tax-efficient salary level is set at the Secondary Threshold (£5,000 from April 2025, previously £9,100). At this level, no employee or employer NI is due, but you still build up qualifying years for the State Pension as long as the salary exceeds the Lower Earnings Limit (£6,396).

Due to the threshold changes in April 2025, many accountants now recommend a salary at the Lower Earnings Limit of £6,396 to maintain State Pension credits while minimising the employer NI hit.

## Common NI Questions

**Do I pay NI on rental income?** No. NI is only charged on earned income (employment or self-employment). Rental income, investment income, and savings interest are not subject to NI.

**Can I opt out of NI?** No. It's mandatory if you're working and earning above the thresholds.

**Does NI stop at State Pension age?** Class 1 and Class 4 NI stop when you reach State Pension age, even if you continue working. Class 2 voluntary contributions can still be made.

**What about NI if I have both employment and self-employment?** You pay Class 1 on employment and Class 4 on self-employment profits. There's a maximum annual NI contribution to prevent excessive charges if you have significant income from both sources.

### ARTICLE 2: CONTRARIAN

**Title:** National Insurance Is a Hidden Tax You'll Never Get Fair Value From. Here's the Maths.

**Meta Description:** You pay thousands in NI over your career. The State Pension it funds is worth far less than investing the same amount privately. The numbers are uncomfortable.

---

National Insurance sounds like insurance. It sounds like you're paying into something that protects you. Sounds like a deal.

It's not a deal. For self-employed people especially, NI is a tax with a misleading name. And when you calculate the actual return on your lifetime contributions, the numbers are genuinely uncomfortable.

## The Return on Investment Nobody Calculates

The full new State Pension pays £221.20/week (£11,502/year). You need 35 qualifying years to get the full amount.

Over those 35 years, a self-employed person earning £40,000 profit annually would pay approximately:

- Class 2 NI: £179 × 35 = £6,265
- Class 4 NI: roughly £1,646 × 35 = £57,610
- **Total NI over 35 years: £63,875**

The State Pension pays £11,502/year. To recoup your contributions, you need to live past State Pension age for approximately 5.5 years (reaching roughly age 73).

That sounds reasonable until you consider the opportunity cost. If you'd invested that £1,825/year (average annual NI contribution) into a pension or ISA at a conservative 5% return, after 35 years you'd have approximately £170,000. At a 4% withdrawal rate, that generates £6,800/year, and you still own the capital.

Nobody tells you this: the State Pension return is worse than a mediocre investment portfolio, and you can't pass it on when you die.

## The Benefits Self-Employed People Pay For But Can't Claim

Employed people paying NI get:
- Statutory Sick Pay (£116.75/week)
- Statutory Maternity/Paternity Pay
- Contribution-based Jobseeker's Allowance
- Contribution-based Employment and Support Allowance

Self-employed people paying NI get:
- State Pension contributions
- Maternity Allowance (lower than Statutory Maternity Pay)
- Contribution-based ESA (if you become unable to work)

Notice what's missing. No sick pay. No Jobseeker's Allowance. You pay less NI, yes, but you're also excluded from benefits that employed people take for granted. And no one gives you the choice, the lower rate is mandated alongside the lower benefits.

If the system were genuinely insurance-based, you'd be able to choose your coverage level and pay accordingly. You can't. It's a compulsory tax dressed up as an insurance scheme.

## The April 2025 Employer NI Increase And What It Means

The government increased employer NI from 13.8% to 15% and reduced the threshold from £9,100 to £5,000. Directly self-employed people aren't affected, but anyone operating through a limited company is.

The salary that used to be NI-free (around £9,100) now triggers employer NI from £5,000 upward. For a director paying themselves £9,100, the additional employer NI cost is approximately £615/year.

This has pushed many limited company directors to reduce their salary to £5,000 and take more in dividends, which aren't subject to NI. The government's additional NI revenue from this measure will be significantly less than projected because rational businesses will adjust their behaviour.

The cycle continues: the government increases a rate, businesses restructure to minimise the impact, the government doesn't collect what it expected, so it increases rates again.

## The Uncomfortable Truth

National Insurance is a pay-as-you-go system. Your contributions don't go into a pot with your name on it. They pay for current pensioners and benefit claimants.

Whether future governments will honour the pension promises made to you depends entirely on political decisions made decades from now. The State Pension age has already risen from 60/65 to 66, and will reach 67 by 2028. Further increases are likely.

You're paying a compulsory tax today based on a promise that politicians 30 years from now might not keep. The safest approach is to treat NI as a tax with no guaranteed return and build your own retirement provision separately.

**Title:** Going Self-Employed in the UK 2026: Everything You Need to Know Before You Start

**Meta Description:** Practical guide to going self-employed in the UK. Registration, tax, insurance, banking, and the things nobody tells you about working for yourself.

---

Going self-employed is one decision. What follows is about fifty more.

You need to register with HMRC, open a business account, understand your tax obligations, figure out insurance, sort your pricing, and somehow find time to actually do the work that earns money.

Most guides cover the basics. This one covers the basics and the things you'll wish someone had mentioned in month two.

## Registering as Self-Employed

You must register with HMRC as self-employed by 5 October following the end of the tax year in which you started trading. So if you start freelancing in June 2026, you need to register by 5 October 2027.

But don't wait. Register immediately. It takes 10 minutes online and delays in registration can cause complications with your first tax return.

Registration is done through the HMRC website. You'll need:
- Your National Insurance number
- Your contact details
- The date you started self-employment
- The nature of your business

You'll receive a Unique Taxpayer Reference (UTR) by post within 10 working days. Keep this number safe. You'll need it for tax returns, some client onboarding processes, and mortgage applications.

Registering as self-employed doesn't mean forming a company. As a sole trader, you and your business are the same legal entity. Your personal assets are at risk if the business incurs debts. This is the simplest and most common structure, used by over 3.5 million people in the UK.

## Tax Obligations: The Non-Negotiables

**Income tax.** You'll file a Self Assessment return each year, declaring your business income and expenses. Tax is calculated on your profit (income minus allowable expenses).

**National Insurance.** You pay Class 2 (£3.45/week) and Class 4 (6% on profits between £12,570 and £50,270, 2% above). These are collected through Self Assessment.

**VAT.** Not initially applicable unless your turnover exceeds £90,000. Below this threshold, VAT registration is optional.

**Payments on account.** After your first year, HMRC requires advance payments toward next year's tax bill. These are due in January and July, each equalling 50% of the previous year's liability. This catches most people off guard because your second January tax bill effectively doubles (last year's balance plus next year's first instalment).

Set aside 25-30% of every payment received into a separate savings account. This isn't your money. It belongs to HMRC. Treat it accordingly.

## Getting Your Finances Right from Day One

**Open a separate bank account.** Not legally required for sole traders, but practically essential. Mixing personal and business transactions makes accounting miserable and increases your chances of HMRC enquiry.

Many business accounts are free for sole traders. Starling, Mettle, and Tide offer fee-free business accounts with good app-based management.

**Choose an accounting method.** Cash basis (record income when received, expenses when paid) is simpler and available for most businesses under £150,000 turnover. Accruals basis (record when invoiced, not when paid) is more complex but gives a more accurate picture of profitability.

**Get accounting software early.** Even a simple tool like FreeAgent or QuickBooks saves hours at tax return time. Connect your bank account and categorise transactions as you go, not in a panicked rush in January.

## Insurance You Actually Need

**Professional indemnity insurance.** If you provide advice or services, this covers claims if a client alleges your work caused them a financial loss. Most business clients require it as a condition of working with you.

**Public liability insurance.** Covers claims if someone is injured or their property is damaged because of your business activities. Essential if you visit client premises, attend events, or have any physical interaction with the public.

**Income protection insurance.** There's no statutory sick pay when you're self-employed. If you can't work due to illness or injury, income protection replaces a portion of your earnings. Policies typically pay 50-70% of your income after a waiting period.

**Business contents insurance.** Covers your equipment: laptop, tools, specialist kit. Your home insurance may not cover items used for business purposes.

Costs vary wildly, but a basic freelancer insurance package (PI + PL) typically runs £150-400/year depending on your profession and turnover.

## Setting Your Prices

This is where most new freelancers get it wrong. They price based on what they earned as an employee, divided by working hours.

That calculation ignores: holiday pay (you have none), sick pay (you have none), pension contributions (you're funding your own), NI employer contributions (absorbed by you), equipment costs, software, insurance, accounting fees, marketing time, admin time, and the reality that you won't bill for every hour available.

A reasonable rule of thumb: take your desired annual salary, add 30% for tax and NI, add 20% for business expenses and non-billable time, then divide by realistic billable hours (typically 1,000-1,200 per year, not 2,000).

Desired salary of £40,000:
- Plus 30% tax/NI: £52,000
- Plus 20% expenses: £62,400
- Divide by 1,100 billable hours: **£57/hour minimum**

If you were thinking of charging £25/hour because that's what you earned employed, this maths explains why that leads to financial stress.

## Things Nobody Tells You

**You'll undercharge initially.** Everyone does. Build in a price review after 3 months. Your first clients accept your low price because it's a bargain. That doesn't mean your price is right.

**Isolation is real.** Working alone, especially from home, can affect mental health. Budget time and money for co-working, networking, or simply getting out of the house.

**Feast and famine is normal.** Two months of more work than you can handle, followed by a month of nothing. This is structural, not a sign of failure. Build savings during feast to survive famine.

**Admin takes more time than you expect.** Invoicing, chasing payments, bookkeeping, marketing, emails. Budget 30-40% of your time for non-billable work.

**Your first tax bill will be bigger than expected.** Because of payments on account, your first January bill can include up to 150% of a normal year's liability. Know this in advance and save accordingly.

### ARTICLE 2: CONTRARIAN

**Title:** Going Self-Employed Is the Most Romanticised Career Move in Britain. Here's the Reality Check.

**Meta Description:** The freedom narrative of self-employment hides some uncomfortable truths about income instability, isolation, and financial vulnerability. Read this before you quit.

---

"Be your own boss." "Choose your own hours." "Unlimited earning potential."

The self-employment marketing is relentless. Social media is packed with people showing off their "laptop lifestyle." Business gurus sell courses on escaping the 9-to-5.

None of them mention the 2am panic about next month's rent. Or the client who owes you £4,000 and won't return your calls. Or the six weeks of flu where you earned exactly nothing.

## The Income Reality

Average self-employed income in the UK is approximately £23,000 per year. Average employed income is approximately £35,000.

Read those numbers again. On average, self-employed people earn 34% less than employees. This isn't because they work less. Many work more. It's because self-employment absorbs enormous chunks of time that nobody pays you for.

Marketing. Invoicing. Chasing payments. Bookkeeping. Tax admin. Networking events that might lead to work but usually don't. Client meetings that turn into "let me think about it."

When you're employed, someone else handles all of this. When you're self-employed, every hour spent on admin is an hour not spent earning.

## Nobody Tells You About the Benefits Gap

Here's a list of things you lose when you go self-employed:

- Employer pension contributions (typically 3-5% of salary)
- Statutory sick pay (£116.75/week)
- Paid holiday (28 days/year)
- Maternity/paternity pay at statutory rates
- Redundancy protection
- Employer NI contributions (15% of your salary)
- Training and development budget
- Life assurance and death in service benefits
- Payroll administration handled for you

The financial value of these benefits for someone earning £35,000 employed is approximately £8,000-12,000 per year. To match your employed position, your self-employed income needs to exceed your previous salary by at least this amount.

Yet most people go self-employed expecting to earn less initially, treating the "freedom" as compensation for the pay cut. Freedom doesn't pay your mortgage.

## The Mental Health Angle Nobody Discusses

Research from the University of Sheffield found that self-employed people report higher levels of anxiety than employees, despite also reporting higher job satisfaction. The combination of autonomy and financial uncertainty creates a specific type of stress.

You're simultaneously more fulfilled and more worried. You love the work and dread the gaps between projects. You feel accomplished and vulnerable at the same time.

The isolation compounds this. A 2024 IPSE survey found that 46% of self-employed people reported feeling lonely or isolated in their work. For remote freelancers, the figure was 61%.

Nobody selling you the dream of self-employment mentions that "being your own boss" also means being your own HR department, counsellor, and cheerleader.

## When Self-Employment Genuinely Works

It works when you have transferable skills that are in genuine demand and can command premium rates. When you have an existing network of potential clients from your employed career. When you have 6-12 months of living expenses saved as a buffer. And when you've priced your services correctly from day one.

It also works when you go in with realistic expectations. Not "unlimited earning potential." More like "the same or slightly more income with significantly more flexibility, in exchange for significantly more responsibility and risk."

That's less sexy than the Instagram pitch. But it's honest. And honest expectations are the foundation of sustainable self-employment.

### ARTICLE 1: STANDARD INFORMATIONAL

**Title:** What Is an SME? UK Definitions, Thresholds, and Why Classification Matters

**Meta Description:** SME stands for Small and Medium-sized Enterprise. Learn the official UK and EU definitions, employee and turnover thresholds, and why your SME classification affects funding and compliance.

---

SME stands for Small and Medium-sized Enterprise. It's a classification, not a compliment, and the specific definition matters because it determines what grants you can access, what regulations apply, and how lenders assess your business.

In the UK, 99.9% of all businesses are SMEs. That's 5.5 million businesses employing nearly 17 million people. When politicians talk about "supporting business," they almost exclusively mean SMEs, whether they realise it or not.

## The Official Definition

The UK follows the EU-origin classification (retained post-Brexit) based on three criteria: employee headcount, annual turnover, and balance sheet total. You only need to meet two of the three to qualify.

| Category | Employees | Turnover | Balance Sheet |
|----------|-----------|----------|--------------|
| Micro | Under 10 | Under £632,000 | Under £316,000 |
| Small | Under 50 | Under £10.2 million | Under £5.1 million |
| Medium | Under 250 | Under £36 million | Under £18 million |

If your business exceeds the "medium" thresholds, you're classified as a large enterprise.

**Important note:** These thresholds use the Companies Act definitions, which differ slightly from those used for certain grant programmes or EU-derived regulations. Always check the specific programme's eligibility criteria.

## Why Your SME Classification Matters

### Access to Funding

Many grant programmes, government-backed loans, and preferential lending schemes are restricted to SMEs or subcategories within SMEs. The Start Up Loans scheme is available to all SMEs under 3 years old. Innovate UK grants often have different rates for micro, small, and medium businesses.

Being classified correctly can be the difference between eligibility and rejection.

### Regulatory Requirements

Larger businesses face additional obligations:

**Audit requirements.** Small companies can claim audit exemption if they meet two of three criteria: turnover under £10.2 million, balance sheet under £5.1 million, or under 50 employees. This saves £5,000-20,000 annually in audit fees.

**Gender pay gap reporting.** Required for businesses with 250+ employees. SMEs are exempt.

**Modern slavery statements.** Required for businesses with turnover above £36 million. Most SMEs are exempt.

**Energy and carbon reporting.** Streamlined requirements apply to "large" companies. SMEs have simplified obligations.

### Tax Advantages

Some tax reliefs are specifically available to SMEs:

**R&D tax credits.** The enhanced SME scheme allows qualifying businesses to claim 186% of qualifying R&D expenditure as a deduction. Large companies receive a lower rate.

**Employment Allowance.** Reduces your employer NI bill by up to £10,500. Available to most SMEs.

**Annual Investment Allowance.** The £1 million limit applies to all businesses, but SMEs disproportionately benefit because it covers most of their capital expenditure entirely.

## Micro-Businesses: The Overlooked Majority

Over 5.2 million UK businesses are micro-businesses (under 10 employees). That's 96% of all UK businesses, and most of them are sole traders with zero employees.

Micro-businesses face unique challenges that SME-wide policies often miss: limited administrative capacity, dependence on one or two key clients, minimal cash reserves, and disproportionate impact from regulatory changes.

If you're a micro-business, look for funding and support specifically targeted at your scale. Programmes designed for "SMEs" sometimes set minimum thresholds you won't meet.

## Growing Beyond SME Status

Crossing from medium to large isn't just a milestone, it's a compliance cliff. Suddenly you're subject to mandatory audits, additional reporting requirements, potentially losing access to SME-specific tax reliefs, and facing increased regulatory scrutiny.

Smart businesses approaching the thresholds plan for this transition. The additional costs of being classified as "large" can reach £50,000-100,000 in compliance and reporting expenses. This needs to be anticipated and budgeted, not discovered after the fact.

---

### ARTICLE 2: CONTRARIAN

**Title:** The SME Label Is a Convenient Fiction That Lets the Government Ignore 96% of UK Businesses

**Meta Description:** Lumping a one-person freelancer and a 200-employee company under "SME" makes policy easy and support useless. The classification problem nobody addresses.

---

A sole trader designing websites from their spare bedroom and a manufacturing firm with 240 employees, £30 million turnover, and a factory are both classified as "SMEs."

The government treats them as though they have similar needs. They don't.

## The Diversity Problem

The SME classification spans businesses with a 25,000x difference in turnover, a 250x difference in headcount, and fundamentally different operational realities.

A micro-business with one employee doesn't need regulatory support programmes. They need an accountant who answers the phone. A medium-sized business doesn't need help registering with HMRC. They need skilled staff and manageable compliance costs.

When the government announces "£2 billion in SME support," it almost universally flows toward the larger end of the spectrum. Grant programmes require multi-page applications that solo operators don't have time to write. Loan schemes have minimum borrowing thresholds that exclude the smallest businesses.

Nobody tells you this: the SME classification exists to make policy announcements sound impressive. "We're helping 5.5 million businesses" reads better than "We're primarily helping the 300,000 businesses with 10-249 employees who are big enough to access our programmes."

## The Policy Gap

Micro-businesses, the 96%, need three things from government: simple tax compliance, affordable insurance, and protection from late payment by larger clients.

They get: Making Tax Digital (additional complexity), auto-enrolment pension obligations (additional cost), and a Prompt Payment Code that large businesses sign voluntarily and ignore routinely.

The disconnect between what micro-businesses need and what policy delivers is explained entirely by the fact that micro-business owners don't have trade associations, lobbyists, or the time to respond to consultations. They're too busy working.

Medium-sized businesses have HR departments, compliance teams, and industry bodies advocating for their interests. Sole traders have themselves and whatever time is left after billable work.

## What Would Actually Help

Separate policy frameworks for micro (0-9), small (10-49), and medium (50-249) businesses, rather than pretending they're the same. Different tax compliance requirements proportionate to complexity. Mandatory late payment interest, not voluntary codes.

The "SME" label makes government reporting easy. It makes effective policy almost impossible.

### ARTICLE 1: STANDARD INFORMATIONAL

**Title:** Self-Employed vs Sole Trader: What's the Difference and Does It Matter?

**Meta Description:** Self-employed and sole trader are often used interchangeably. They're not the same thing. Here's what each term means and how it affects your taxes and liability.

---

People use "self-employed" and "sole trader" as if they mean the same thing. They're related, but they're not identical, and understanding the distinction matters when you're registering with HMRC, choosing a business structure, or signing contracts.

## The Real Difference

**Self-employed** is an employment status. It means you work for yourself rather than being employed by someone else. You control when, where, and how you work. HMRC uses specific tests to determine whether someone is genuinely self-employed or should be treated as an employee.

**Sole trader** is a business structure. It's the simplest way to operate as self-employed. You and your business are legally the same entity. There's no separate company, no shareholders, no formal registration at Companies House.

The key relationship: all sole traders are self-employed, but not all self-employed people are sole traders. You can be self-employed and operate through a limited company, a partnership, or a limited liability partnership (LLP).

## Sole Trader: What It Means in Practice

As a sole trader:

- You keep all profits after tax
- You're personally liable for all business debts
- Your personal and business assets aren't legally separated
- You file a Self Assessment tax return
- You pay income tax and National Insurance on profits
- You can trade under your own name or a business name
- No requirement to file at Companies House
- You don't need to publish your accounts publicly

**Setting up:** Register with HMRC for Self Assessment. That's it. No formation documents, no company secretary, no memorandum and articles.

**Accounting:** Simpler than limited company accounting. Cash basis accounting is available for turnover under £150,000. No requirement for formal company accounts.

## Limited Company: The Alternative

Operating through a limited company means:

- The company is a separate legal entity from you
- Your personal liability is limited to your investment in the company
- You pay corporation tax on company profits
- You take income as a combination of salary and dividends
- You must file annual accounts at Companies House (public record)
- More complex accounting and compliance requirements
- You can be both a director and an employee of your own company

**The tax efficiency question:** At around £30,000-40,000 annual profit, a limited company structure starts saving tax compared to sole trading. The exact crossover depends on how much you need to extract from the business and your personal circumstances.

A sole trader earning £50,000 profit pays approximately £11,364 in income tax and NI.

A limited company director extracting the same £50,000 through an optimal salary/dividend split pays approximately £9,200-10,000 in combined corporation tax, income tax, and NI. Savings of roughly £1,400-2,100 per year.

But add accountancy fees of £1,000-2,000 for limited company compliance, and the net saving shrinks considerably, potentially to zero.

## Which Should You Choose?

**Stay as a sole trader if:**
- Your profit is under £30,000
- You want minimal admin
- You're testing a business idea
- Your personal liability risk is low
- You value simplicity over tax optimisation

**Consider a limited company if:**
- Your profit consistently exceeds £40,000
- Personal liability protection matters (e.g., you take on significant contracts)
- You want to retain profits in the company for reinvestment
- You're planning to bring in investors or partners
- Your clients require you to operate through a company

**Consider a partnership or LLP if:**
- You're starting a business with one or more partners
- You want shared ownership without full corporate structure

The right structure depends on your specific situation. What works for a graphic designer earning £30,000 doesn't work for a consultant earning £100,000 or a contractor managing liability risk.

### ARTICLE 2: CONTRARIAN

**Title:** The Sole Trader vs Limited Company Debate Is Mostly a Distraction. Here's What Actually Matters.

**Meta Description:** Everyone obsesses over business structure for tax savings. The actual savings are usually trivial compared to the things nobody focuses on: pricing, expenses, and pension strategy.

---

Every freelancer forum has the same thread: "Should I go limited?" It spawns 200 replies, half of which are wrong, and the original poster spends three months researching something that might save them £1,200 per year.

Meanwhile, they're undercharging by £10,000, missing £3,000 in legitimate deductions, and not contributing to a pension at all.

The business structure debate consumes enormous mental energy for relatively modest returns.

## The Savings Are Real But Small

At £50,000 profit, the tax difference between sole trader and limited company is approximately £1,400-2,100 per year before accountancy costs. After accountancy costs (a limited company requires more complex accounts, typically £1,000-2,000 more than sole trader accounts), the net saving is often under £500.

For context, raising your hourly rate by £5, a conversation that takes an afternoon, generates £5,000-6,000 in additional annual revenue. Claiming the home office allowance properly adds £300-500. Contributing to a pension saves £1,000-3,000 in tax depending on your bracket.

Structure is the least impactful optimisation you can make.

## Nobody Tells You About the Hassle Cost

A limited company requires:
- Annual confirmation statement filing (Companies House)
- Annual accounts preparation and filing
- Corporation tax return (CT600)
- Personal Self Assessment return (for your salary and dividends)
- Maintaining statutory records
- Running payroll (even for just yourself)
- Potentially a registered office service

A sole trader requires:
- One Self Assessment return per year

The administrative overhead of a limited company is roughly 15-25 additional hours per year. If your time is worth £50/hour, that's £750-1,250 in hidden costs.

Add this to the increased accountancy fees and the "savings" from incorporation evaporate for most freelancers earning under £60,000.

## What Actually Moves the Needle

**Price correctly.** Going from £40/hour to £55/hour, which is still below market rate for most skilled freelancers, adds £15,000 to your annual revenue. No structure change does this.

**Claim everything.** Most sole traders leave £2,000-5,000 in legitimate deductions on the table. Home office, mileage, equipment, software, professional development, insurance, phone, broadband. Every unclaimed pound costs you 20-40% in unnecessary tax.

**Use your pension.** A sole trader contributing £10,000 to a pension effectively reduces their tax bill by £2,000-4,000 depending on their rate. This dwarfs any structural saving.

Focus on these three things first. If you're still paying more tax than you'd like after optimising pricing, deductions, and pension contributions, then consider whether incorporation makes sense.

The structure decision should be the last optimisation you make, not the first.

### ARTICLE 1: STANDARD INFORMATIONAL

**Title:** How to Register as a Sole Trader or Limited Company in the UK: Step-by-Step

**Meta Description:** Register your business in minutes. Complete guide to setting up as a sole trader with HMRC or incorporating a limited company at Companies House.

---

Starting a business in the UK doesn't require months of paperwork. Registering as a sole trader takes 10 minutes online. Incorporating a limited company takes about 48 hours and costs £50.

The harder decision isn't how to register. It's which structure to choose. Once you've made that choice, the actual registration process is straightforward.

## Registering as a Sole Trader

### What You Need Before You Start

- National Insurance number
- Personal contact details
- The date you started (or plan to start) self-employment
- The nature of your business (HMRC uses SIC codes, but you can describe it in plain English)

### The Registration Process

**Step 1:** Go to HMRC's online registration page (search "register for Self Assessment" on gov.uk).

**Step 2:** Create a Government Gateway account if you don't have one.

**Step 3:** Complete the online form with your personal and business details.

**Step 4:** Receive your Unique Taxpayer Reference (UTR) by post within 10 working days.

**Step 5:** Receive an activation code separately, also by post.

That's it. You're registered.

**Deadline:** You must register by 5 October following the end of the tax year in which you started trading. Starting in July 2026? Register by 5 October 2027. But registering immediately is recommended because it avoids complications.

### What Registration Means

You're now registered for Self Assessment and Class 2 National Insurance. You'll need to file a tax return by 31 January following the end of each tax year and pay any tax due by the same date.

You don't need to register at Companies House. You don't need to publish accounts publicly. You can start trading immediately using your own name or a chosen business name.

**Choosing a business name:** You can trade under any name you like as a sole trader, as long as it doesn't include "limited," "ltd," "plc," or similar terms that imply incorporation. You must display your own name and address on business correspondence.

## Incorporating a Limited Company

### What You Need Before You Start

- A company name (checked against existing registrations at Companies House)
- At least one director (can be you)
- At least one shareholder (can also be you)
- A registered office address (can be your home, or a third-party address)
- Details of people with significant control (PSC, usually you if you own 25%+ shares)
- SIC code for your business activity

### The Registration Process

**Step 1:** Go to Companies House's web incorporation service.

**Step 2:** Check your desired company name is available.

**Step 3:** Complete the online form with company details, director information, shareholder details, and initial share allocation.

**Step 4:** Pay the £50 registration fee (same-day electronic processing).

**Step 5:** Receive your Certificate of Incorporation, usually within 24 hours of submission.

You'll also need to:
- Register for Corporation Tax with HMRC within 3 months of starting to trade
- Set up PAYE if you plan to pay yourself a salary
- Register for VAT if applicable (turnover above £90,000, or voluntary)
- Open a business bank account in the company's name

### Formation Agents

Services like Companies House Direct, Rapid Formations, and 1st Formations offer company formation packages from £10-100. They speed up the process and often include:
- Name availability checking
- Standard Memorandum and Articles of Association
- Share certificates
- Registered office address services
- Company documents templates

For most straightforward incorporations, the DIY route through Companies House is perfectly adequate. Formation agents add value if you need a registered office service, specific share structures, or want someone else to handle the paperwork.

## After Registration: Essential Next Steps

**For both structures:**
1. Open a dedicated business bank account
2. Set up accounting software or engage an accountant
3. Arrange business insurance appropriate to your activity
4. Register for VAT if required or beneficial
5. Start keeping records of all income and expenses

**Additional for limited companies:**
6. Set up payroll (even if only for yourself)
7. Understand your annual filing obligations (confirmation statement, accounts, CT600)
8. Familiarise yourself with director responsibilities

### ARTICLE 2: CONTRARIAN

**Title:** Everyone Rushes to Register Their Business. Smart People Test First.

**Meta Description:** You don't need to register anything to test a business idea. The registration obsession delays the only thing that matters: finding out if customers exist.

---

"First things first, register your business." This is the opening line of every how-to-start-a-business guide. And it's terrible advice.

Registration is paperwork. Paperwork doesn't validate a business idea. Customers validate a business idea.

## The Registration Obsession

New entrepreneurs get a dopamine hit from registration. You've made it official. You have a UTR number. You've chosen a company name. You feel like a business owner.

You're not a business owner. You're a person with a government reference number and, crucially, no customers.

Nobody tells you this: you can legally provide services, send invoices, and receive payment before you register as a sole trader. You have until 5 October following the end of the tax year to register. The registration deadline exists to ensure you file your tax return, not to authorise you to trade.

Many successful businesses started with an informal "let me see if anyone will pay for this" phase before formalising anything. Testing demand costs nothing. Premature incorporation costs £50 (plus ongoing compliance) for a business that might not survive month three.

## The Limited Company Trap for New Businesses

Here's an observation from accountants who work with startups: roughly 40% of limited companies formed by new entrepreneurs become dormant within 2 years.

They incorporated because someone told them it looked more professional. Or because a blog said they'd save on tax. What nobody mentioned is that a dormant limited company still requires:
- An annual confirmation statement (£13/year)
- Dormant company accounts filed at Companies House
- A corporation tax return telling HMRC you're dormant

These obligations continue until you formally dissolve the company. Dissolution costs £12 and requires a separate process. Many people forget, leading to Companies House reminders, potential penalties, and a zombie company on their record.

## What to Do Instead

**Test first.** Can you sell your product or service to three people? Can you do it profitably? Can you do it repeatedly?

**Register when you have traction.** Once money is flowing and you're confident the business works, register appropriately.

**Start as a sole trader.** The simplest structure, lowest admin, and you can always incorporate later if the business grows enough to justify it.

**Incorporate only when the numbers demand it.** Consistent profit above £40,000. Genuine liability exposure. Client requirements. Actual reasons, not theoretical tax savings on income that doesn't exist yet.

The best registration timing isn't "first thing." It's "once you know this is real."
